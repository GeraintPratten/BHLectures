\section{Stationary and static spacetimes}

\subsection{Definitions} \label{s:sta:def_station}

\begin{greybox}
A spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is called \defin{stationary}\index{stationary!spacetime}
iff (i) it is invariant under
the action of the translation group $(\mathbb{R},+)$ and (ii) the orbits of
the group action (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:symmetries})
are everywhere timelike curves or (ii') $(\M,\w{g})$
admits a conformal completion (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:conf_compl})
and the orbits of the group action are timelike in the vicinity of
the conformal boundary $\scri$.
It is equivalent to say that there exists a Killing vector field
$\w{\xi}$ (the generator of the translation group, cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:symmetries}) that is
timelike everywhere or at least in the vicinity of $\scri$ when there exists a conformal
completion. We shall say that $(\M,\w{g})$ is \defin{strictly stationary}\index{strictly!stationary}\index{stationary!strictly --} iff the Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$ is timelike in all $\M$,
i.e. iff the point (ii) above is fulfilled.
\end{greybox}

\begin{remark} \label{r:sta:pseudo-stationary}
Some authors (e.g. Carter \cite{Carte73b}) call
\emph{pseudo-stationary}\index{pseudo-stationary} the stationary spacetimes
defined above, keeping the qualifier
\emph{stationary} for the strictly stationary case.
As we are going to see, when $\M$
contains a black hole, $\w{\xi}$ cannot be timelike everywhere,
so only \emph{pseudo-stationarity} in the above sense is relevant for these spacetimes.
Our terminology follows that of
Heusler \cite{Heusl96},
Chru\'sciel, Lopes Costa \& Heusler \cite{ChrusLH12}
and Choquet-Bruhat \cite{Choqu09}.
\end{remark}

A notion stronger than stationarity is that of \emph{staticity}:

\begin{greybox}
A spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is called \defin{static}\index{static!spacetime}
iff (i) it is stationary and (ii) the Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$
generating the stationary action is orthogonal to a family of hypersurfaces
(one says that $\w{\xi}$ is \defin{hypersurface-orthogonal}\index{hypersurface-orthogonal}).
The spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is called \defin{strictly static}\index{strictly!static}\index{static!strictly --}
iff $\w{\xi}$ is timelike in all $\M$.
\end{greybox}

\begin{remark}
The same comment as in Remark~\ref{r:sta:pseudo-stationary} can be made: some authors
would call \emph{static} only spacetimes that are
\emph{strictly static} according to the above definition.
\end{remark}

In loose terms, a spacetime is stationary if nothing ``changes with time'', while
it is static if, in addition, nothing ``moves''. A prototype of a stationary
spacetime that is not static is a spacetime containing a steadily rotating
body, be it a star or a black hole.


\subsection{Coordinates adapted to stationarity or staticity}

In a $n$-dimensional stationary spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$, a coordinate system $(x^\alpha) = (x^0=t, x^1, \ldots  x^{n-1})$
is said \defin{adapted to stationarity}\index{adapted!coordinates} iff the coordinate vector
$\wpar_t$ coincides with the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$.
It has been shown in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:symmetries} that the components $g_{\alpha\beta}$
of the metric tensor with respect to $(x^\alpha)$ obeys then $\dert{g_{\alpha\beta}}{t} = 0$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:dgabdt_zero})]. It follows that
\be
   g_{\alpha\beta}  = g_{\alpha\beta}(x^1, \ldots  x^{n-1}) .
\ee
One says that $t$ is an \defin{ignorable coordinate}\index{ignorable coordinate}.

If the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is static, a coordinate system $(x^\alpha) = (x^0=t, x^1, \ldots  x^{n-1})$
is said \defin{adapted to staticity} iff it is adapted to stationarity and the hypersurfaces
$t=\mathrm{const}$ are orthogonal to the static Killing vector $\w{\xi}$.
Given that a normal 1-form to the hypersurfaces $t=\mathrm{const}$ is $\dd t$,
the coordinates $(x^\alpha)$ are adapted to staticity iff
\be \label{e:sta:xi_wpar_t}
    \w{\xi} = \wpar_t \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad \uu{\xi} = (\w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi})\, \dd t ,
\ee
where $\uu{\xi}$ is the metric dual of $\w{\xi}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:metric_dual}).
The orthogonality of $\wpar_t$ and the hypersurfaces $t=\mathrm{const}$
translates to $g_{0i}=0$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$,
the $g_{\alpha\beta}$'s being the metric components with respect to the coordinates
$(x^\alpha)$. Hence one may write the metric of a static spacetime of dimension $n$ as
\be \label{e:sta:static_metric}
    \w{g} = V \dd t^2 + g_{ij} \dd x^i \dd x^j ,
\ee
where $V := \w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi}$, the indices $(i,j)$ range in $\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$
and $V$ and $g_{ij}$ are functions of $(x^1,\ldots,x^{n-1})$ only.
It is clear that the metric (\ref{e:sta:static_metric}) is invariant\footnote{Would
(\ref{e:sta:static_metric}) have contained a non-vanishing $g_{0i}\, \D t \, \D x^i$ term,
this would not have been the case.} in the
transformation $t\mapsto-t$. One says that a static spacetime is
\defin{time-reflection symmetric}\index{time!reflection symmetry}\index{reflection!time --}.


\subsection{Black holes in stationary spacetimes}
\label{s:sta:BH_stationary}

Let us consider a spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ that contains a \emph{black hole}, as defined in
Sec.~\ref{s:glo:def_BH}. In particular, $(\M,\w{g})$ admits a future null
infinity $\scri^+$ and a past null infinity $\scri^-$.
Furthermore, we assume that $(\M,\w{g})$ is \emph{stationary},
as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:sta:def_station}.
Since $(\M,\w{g})$ is invariant under the action of the isometry group $(\mathbb{R},+)$,
so is $\scri^+$ (under some proper extension of $\w{\xi}$ to the conformal
completion $\tilde{\M}$)
and therefore its causal past $J^-(\scri^+)$. As the boundary of $J^-(\scri^+)$
inside $\M$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:glo:Hor_bound_past_scrip})],
the event horizon $\Hor$ must therefore be invariant under the
action of the isometry group.
Note that this means that $\Hor$ is invariant \emph{as a whole}, not that
each point of $\Hor$ is invariant (i.e. is a fixed point of the group action).
Let us assume that $\Hor$ is smooth (which sounds likely in a stationary context;
a rigorous proof can be found in Ref.~\cite{ChrusDGH01});
it is then a null hypersurface (Property~\ref{p:glo:prop4} in Sec.~\ref{s:glo:properties_H}).
Now, $\Hor$ is globally invariant if, and only if, the
generator $\w{\xi}$ of the isometry group is tangent to $\Hor$.
Since a timelike vector cannot be tangent to a null hypersurface (cf.
Lemma~\ref{p:def:tangent_to_null_hyp} in Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}), we conclude:

\begin{prop}[stationary Killing vector tangent to the event horizon]
\label{p:sta:xi_tangent_H}
In a stationary spacetime containing a black hole,
the stationary Killing vector field  $\w{\xi}$ is tangent to the event horizon
$\Hor$, which implies that $\w{\xi}$ is either null or spacelike on $\Hor$.
\end{prop}

Since $\w{\xi}$ cannot be timelike on $\Hor$, it follows immediately
that a stationary spacetime that contains a black hole cannot be strictly stationary.
We shall discuss in detail the two cases --- null or spacelike --- allowed
for $\w{\xi}$ on $\Hor$ in Sec.~\ref{s:sta:EH_KH}.

It is rather intuitive that the event horizon $\Hor$ of a black hole in
a stationary spactime must have a vanishing expansion $\theta_{(\wl)}$ along its null
normals $\wl$, otherwise the area of cross-sections would vary when dragged
along $\wl$ and this would define some ``evolution'' along $\Hor$ (e.g. from the small areas
to the larger ones),
which would break the invariance of $\Hor$ under the action of the stationary group.
This of course results from $\Hor$ being part of the global spacetime structure,
since not any null hypersurface in a stationary spacetime has a vanishing
expansion: for instance, a future light cone in Minkowski spacetime
(which is stationary!) has $\theta_{(\wl)}>0$
(cf. Example~\ref{x:def:light_cone6} on p.~\pageref{x:def:light_cone6}),
but the light cone is not invariant by any time translation isometry.
The rigorous proof that $\theta_{(\wl)} = 0$
for stationary event horizons can be found in Hawking \& Ellis' textbook
(Proposition~9.3.1 of Ref.~\cite{HawkiE73}).
Here, we shall simply state
\begin{prop}
\label{p:sta:hor_non_exanding}
The event horizon $\Hor$ of a black hole in stationary spacetime
is a null hypersurface of vanishing expansion:
\be
    \theta_{(\wl)} = 0 .
\ee
If its cross-sections are compact manifolds, $\Hor$ is then a \emph{non-expanding horizon},
according to the definition introduced in Chap.~\ref{s:neh}.
\end{prop}

In dimension 4, one can strongly constrain the cross-sections, thanks to the
topology theorem:

\begin{prop}[topology theorem 1 \textnormal{(Hawking 1972 \cite{Hawki72})}]
\label{p:sta:topology1}
Let $(\M, \w{g})$ be a 4-dimensional stationary spacetime
containing a black hole of event horizon $\Hor$.
Let us assume that
(i) the null dominant energy condition (\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond})
is fulfilled on $\Hor$ for some scalar field $f \geq 0$
[for general relativity with $f=\Lambda$
this is equivalent to assuming $\Lambda \geq 0$ and
the matter dominant null energy condition (\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond_T})]
and (ii) when
displaced into the black hole region along the ingoing null normal $\w{k}$, the
cross-sections of $\Hor$ become surfaces with $\theta_{(\wl)} < 0$.
Then, any connected component $\Sp$ of a cross-section of $\Hor$
has the topology of the sphere $\SS^2$ (i.e. $\Sp$ is
\emph{homeomorphic}\index{homeomorphic} to $\SS^2$).
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $\Sp$ be a cross-section of the event horizon $\Hor$,
$\wl$ a future-directed null normal to $\Hor$ and $\w{k}$ a complementary
future-directed null vector field
normal to $\Sp$, normalized as in Eq.~(\ref{e:def:k_el_minus_one}), i.e.
$\w{k}\cdot\wl = -1$. At each point $p\in \Sp$, the pair $(\w{k},\wl)$ is
a basis of the 2-plane orthogonal to $\Sp$, $T_p^\perp\Sp$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:def:TS_ortho}),
with $\wl$ tangent to $\Hor$ and $\w{k}$ transverse to it.
As in Sec.~\ref{s:def:geom_null_hypsurf}, let us consider that $\Hor$
is the level set $u=0$ of 1-parameter family of hypersurfaces $(\Hor_u)_{u\in\R}$.
This extends $\wl$ in the vinicity of $\Hor$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:def:wl_rho_u})
as a null vector field normal to each $\Hor_u$.
By Property~\ref{p:sta:hor_non_exanding}, we have $\theta_{(\wl)} = 0$
on $\Sp$. Let us displace $\Sp$ by a small parameter $\eps>0$ along the inward
null normal $\w{k}$. The expansion along $\wl$ of the obtained surface is
negative by hypothesis (ii). By taking the limit $\eps\to 0$, we form the
derivative $\Lie{\w{k}} \theta_{(\wl)}$, which must obey
\be \label{e:sta:Lie_k_l}
    \Lie{\w{k}} \theta_{(\wl)} < 0 .
\ee
since $\theta_{(\wl)} = 0$ on $\Sp$ and
$\theta_{(\wl)} < 0$ on the displaced surface.
A standard identity (cf. e.g. Eq.~(3b) of \cite{Haywa94}, Eq.~(3.1) of \cite{BoothF07},
Eq.~(96) of \cite{Cao11} or Eq.~(36) of \cite{Jaram13})
expresses $\Lie{\w{k}}\theta_{(\wl)}$ as
\be \label{e:sta:Lie_k_theta_l}
    \Lie{\w{k}} \theta_{(\wl)} = - \frac{1}{2} {}^\Sp\!\! R - \DSc_a \Omega^a
    +  \Omega_a \Omega^a + \w{G}(\w{k},\wl) ,
\ee
where ${}^\Sp\!\! R$ is the Ricci scalar of the Riemannian metric $\w{q}$ on
$\Sp$ induced by the spacetime metric $\w{g}$, $\DS$ is the Levi-civita
connection associated to $\w{q}$ (already introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:zeroth_law}),
$\w{G}$ is the Einstein tensor
of the spacetime metric $\w{g}$ and $\w{\Omega}$ is the 1-form on $\Sp$
that is the pullback of the 1-form $\w{\omega}$ defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:def:def_omega}).
We may also view $\w{\Omega}$ as a spacetime 1-form: it is then defined as
the composition of $\w{\omega}$ with the orthogonal projector $\vw{q}$ onto
$\Sp$: $\w{\Omega} = \w{\omega} \circ \vw{q}$.
In view of Eq.~(\ref{e:def:omega_restrict_H}), we may then write
$\langle\w{\Omega}, \w{v} \rangle = - \w{k} \cdot\wnab_{\vw{q}(\w{v})} \w{\ell}$,
or in index notation, $\Omega_\alpha  = - k_\mu \nabla_\nu \el^\mu q^\nu_{\ \, \alpha}$.
Using Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond}), we may express $\w{G}(\w{k},\wl)$
as $\w{G}(\w{k},\wl) = \w{G}(\wl, \w{k}) = - \w{W}\cdot\w{k} - f \wl\cdot \w{k} = - \w{W}\cdot\w{k} + f$.
Then, integrating (\ref{e:sta:Lie_k_theta_l}) over $\Sp$
and setting the integral of the divergence term $\DSc_a \Omega^a$ to zero since
$\Sp$ has no boundary, we get
\be \label{e:sta:Euler_char}
    \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \int_\Sp  {}^\Sp\!\! R \, \sqrt{q} \, \D^2 x}_{2\pi\chi} = \int_\Sp \Big[
    \underbrace{\Omega_a \Omega^a}_{\geq 0}
    \, \underbrace{- \w{W}\cdot\w{k}}_{\geq 0}
    + \underbrace{f}_{\geq 0}
    \, \underbrace{- \Lie{\w{k}} \theta_{(\wl)}}_{> 0} \Big]
          \sqrt{q} \, \D^2 x .
\ee
In the left-hand side, we have invoked the Gauss-Bonnet theorem\index{Gauss-Bonnet theorem}
to express the integral of ${}^\Sp\!\! R$ in terms
of the Euler characteristic\index{Euler characteristic} $\chi$ of the
surface $\Sp$, using the fact that in dimension 2,
the Ricci scalar ${}^\Sp\!\! R$ is twice the
Gaussian curvature\index{Gaussian!curvature}\index{curvature!Gaussian --}.
The signs of the terms of the integrand in the right-hand side
are justified as follows:
$\Omega_a \Omega^a = q^{ab} \Omega_a \Omega_b \geq 0$ because $\w{q}$ is a Riemannian metric,
$- \w{W}\cdot\w{k} \geq 0$ by Lemma~\ref{p:fra:lem2} in Sec.~\ref{s:fra:time_orientation},
given that $\w{k}$ is a future-directed null vector and $\w{W}$ is a future-directed
causal vector thanks to the null dominant enegy condition (\ref{e:neh:null_dominant_cond}),
$f\geq 0$ by hypothesis and $- \Lie{\w{k}} \theta_{(\wl)} > 0$
follows from Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Lie_k_l}). The Euler characteristic $\chi$ is a topological
invariant, which is $2$ for the sphere $\SS^2$, $0$ for the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$
and $-2(g-1)$
for a connected orientable surface of genus $g$, i.e. with $g$ ``holes''.
Equation~(\ref{e:sta:Euler_char}) yields $\chi > 0$. Given that the only orientable
compact 2-manifolds
with positive Euler characteristic are those homeomorphic to $\SS^2$ or
to some disjoint union of $\SS^2$'s, the theorem follows.
\end{proof}

Another version of the topology theorem relies on the null energy
condition, which is weaker than the dominant energy condition assumed in (i) above,
and replaces the hypothesis (ii) by other ones, which are more global:

\begin{prop}[topology theorem 2 \textnormal{(Chru\'sciel\index{Chrusciel, P.T.@Chru\'sciel, P.T.} \& Wald\index{Wald, R.M.} 1994 \cite{ChrusW94b})}]
\label{p:sta:topology2}
Let $(\M, \w{g})$ be a 4-dimensional asymptotically flat stationary spacetime
containing a black hole of event horizon $\Hor$.
Let us assume that (i) the
null energy condition (\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond}) is fulfilled,
(ii) the domain of outer communications\index{domain of outer communications} $\langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:glo:def_doc})]
is globally hyperbolic,
(iii) $\langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle$ contains an achronal asymptotically
flat hypersurface $\Sigma$ that intersects $\Hor$ in a compact cross-section $\Sp$,
and (iv) some technical condition is fulfilled (cf. \cite{ChrusW94b} for the details).
Then, $\langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle$ is simply connected and
any connected component of $\Sp$ is homeomorphic to the sphere $\SS^2$.
\end{prop}
We shall not give the proof here, refering to the original article by Chru\'sciel
\& Wald \cite{ChrusW94b}.

\begin{remark}
The topology theorem 1, as stated above, is slightly different from the original
version given by Hawking \cite{Hawki72,Hawki73,HawkiE73}, for it adds the ``outermost'' hypothesis (ii).
The latter is very mild and fixes some shortcoming in Hawking's proof
(cf. the historical note below).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The topology theorem 1 is not specific to black hole event horizons, for
it relies only on quasilocal properties. Indeed, the proof does not use
that $\Hor$ is the boundary of a black hole region, only that $\Hor$ is a hypersuface
sliced by surfaces with $\theta_{(\wl)} = 0$ and $\Lie{\w{k}} \theta_{(\wl)} < 0$.
The theorem is therefore valid for \emph{outer trapping horizons} \cite{Haywa94}
and (tubes of) \emph{apparent horizons}, as noticed by Hawking himself \cite{Hawki73} (p.~34),
which are not necessarily null hypersurfaces and which exist in non-stationary spacetimes.
Both concepts of \emph{outer trapping horizons} and \emph{apparent horizon}
will be discussed in Chap.~\ref{s:loc}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The topology theorems 1 and 2 regard only
a \emph{connected component} of a given horizon cross-section.
Generally, this corresponds to the whole cross-section, i.e. the cross-section
is a connected 2-manifold, but there exist
4-dimensional stationary (actually static) spacetimes containing a black hole,
the event horizon of which has
disconnected cross-sections: these are the
\emph{Majumdar-Papapetrou spacetimes}\index{Majumdar-Papapetrou black hole}
\cite{Majum47,Papap47,HartlH72}. They are solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell
equations representing an arbitrary number of charged black holes,
which form a static configuration thanks to
an exact balance between the gravitational
attraction and the electrostatic repulsion.
\end{remark}

A generalization of the topology theorem 1 to spacetimes of
dimension $n>4$ has been obtained in 2006 by Galloway \& Schoen \cite{GalloS06}
and R\'acz\index{Racz, I.@R\'acz, I.} provided a simplified
proof of it in 2008 \cite{Racz08}.
However, the theorem for $n>4$ only says that some invariant
of the smooth structure of $\Sp$, called the
\emph{Yamabe invariant}\index{Yamabe invariant}, must be positive for
$f \geq 0$ (\footnote{In brief, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Euler_char}) holds for $n>4$
as well, except that the integral of the Ricci scalar ${}^\Sp\!\!R$ is no longer
proportional to the Euler characteristic of $\Sp$ (no Gauss-Bonnet theorem for $\mathrm{dim}\, \Sp \neq 2$ !) but is connected to the Yamabe constant of the conformal class of the metric $\w{q}$.}). This result implies that $\Sp$ must admit metrics of positive scalar curvature; it is
less stringent about the topology of $\Sp$ than the theorem for $n=4$.
Actually, the higher $n$, the less contraints on
the topology are provided by the Yamabe invariant. For instance,
for $n=5$, the cross-sections of the \emph{Myers-Perry black holes}\index{Myers-Perry black hole} \cite{MyersP86,EmparR08,Reall14}, which generalize
Kerr black holes to $n>4$, have the
topology of the sphere $\SS^3$, but the topology
$\SS^1\times\SS^2$ is allowed as well, as demonstrated
by the \emph{black ring}\index{black!ring} solution found by Emparan \& Reall \cite{EmparR02,EmparR08,Reall14} (see also Sec.~5.3 of Ref.~\cite{Chrus20}).


\begin{hist}
The topology theorem for the spacetime dimension $n=4$ has been formulated
first by Stephen Hawking\index{Hawking, S.W.} in 1992 \cite{Hawki72}
(see also p.~34 of Ref.~\cite{Hawki73} and Proposition~9.3.2 in Hawking \& Ellis' textbook
\cite{HawkiE73}).
However, in 1993, Gregory Galloway\index{Galloway, G.J.} \cite{Gallo94}
pointed out some limitation in Hawking's proof, namely that it cannot
exclude the torus topology ($\chi = 0$) for the horizon's cross-sections
without assuming that the spacetime is analytic, which is a much stronger
assumption that the smoothness usually assumed (cf. the discussion in Sec.~??).
The proof presented above is free from this limitation, since it leads to
$\chi > 0$, which excludes the torus. This proof is based on that given
by Sean Hayward\index{Hayward, S.} in 1994 \cite{Haywa94}
for future outer trapping horizons (see also the proof of Theorem~6.3 in Ref.~\cite{Newma87}).
The theorem obtained by Piotr Chru\'sciel\index{Chrusciel, P.T.@Chru\'sciel, P.T.}
and Robert Wald\index{Wald, R.M.} in 1994 \cite{ChrusW94b}
(Property~\ref{p:sta:topology2})
relies on the \emph{topological censorship theorem}\index{topological censorship theorem} established by
John L. Friedman\index{Friedman, J.L.}, Kristin Schleich\index{Schleich, K.}
and Donald M. Witt\index{Witt, D.M.} in 1993 \cite{FriedSW93}.
It leads directly to the spherical topology, excluding the toroidal one.

\section{Bifurcate Killing horizons} \label{s:sta:bifur_Killing_hor}

If the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$,
which is tangent to $\Hor$ by Property~\ref{p:sta:xi_tangent_H},
is null on $\Hor$, it is then necessarily normal to $\Hor$
(cf. Lemma~\ref{p:def:tangent_to_null_hyp} in Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}).
According to the definition given in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:def_Killing_hor},
$\Hor$ is then a \emph{Killing horizon}.
On the other hand, if $\w{\xi}$ is spacelike on $\Hor$,
we shall see in Sec.~\ref{s:sta:strong_rigidity} that, modulo some
assumptions, $\Hor$ is a Killing
horizon as well, albeit not with respect to $\w{\xi}$ but to another
Killing vector. This motivates to move on in the study of Killing horizons,
beyond what was achieved in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:Killing_hor},
starting by the concept of
bifurcate Killing horizons.

\subsection{Definition and first properties} \label{s:sta:bifur_def}

\begin{greybox}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a $n$-dimensional spacetime endowed with a Killing vector
field $\w{\xi}$. A
\defin{bifurcate Killing horizon}\index{bifurcate!Killing horizon}\index{Killing!horizon!bifurcate --}\index{horizon!bifurcate Killing --} is the
union
\be
    \Hor = \Hor_1 \cup \Hor_2 ,
\ee
such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Hor_1$ and $\Hor_2$ are two null hypersurfaces;
\item $\Sp:=\Hor_1\cap\Hor_2$ is a spacelike $(n-2)$-surface;
\item each of the sets $\Hor_1\setminus\Sp$ and $\Hor_2\setminus\Sp$ has two connected components, which are
Killing horizons\footnote{Cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:def_Killing_hor} for the
definition of a Killing horizon.} with respect to $\w{\xi}$.
\end{itemize}
The $(n-2)$-dimensional submanifold $\Sp$ is called the
\defin{bifurcation surface}\index{bifurcation!surface} of $\Hor$.
\end{greybox}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sta_bifur_Kill_hor.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:sta:bifur_Kill_hor} \footnotesize
Bifurcate Killing horizon $\Hor_1\cup\Hor_2$ with respect to the Killing vector
field $\w{\xi}$; $\Sp$ is the bifurcation surface. $\Li_1$ and $\Li_2$ are
null geodesic generators of respectively $\Hor_1$ and $\Hor_2$, which cross
each other at the point $p\in\Sp$.}
\end{figure}

Hence we may say that a bifurcate Killing horizon is formed by four Killing horizons,
$\Hor_1^+$, $\Hor_1^-$, $\Hor_2^+$ and $\Hor_2^-$ say,
which are merged together at the bifurcation surface $\Sp$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:bifur_Kill_hor}), in such a way that
\[
    \Hor_1 = \Hor_1^- \cup \Sp \cup \Hor_1^+ \quad \mbox{and}\quad
    \Hor_2 = \Hor_2^- \cup \Sp \cup \Hor_2^+
\]
are null hypersurfaces.

A first property of bifurcate Killing horizons is
\begin{prop}[vanishing of the Killing vector on the bifurcation surface]
\label{p:sta:xi_S_zero}
The Killing vector field vanishes on the bifurcation surface:
\be \label{e:sta:xi_S_zero}
    \encadre{\left. \w{\xi} \right| _{\Sp} = 0 } .
\ee
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $p\in \Sp$ and let us assume that $\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p\not=0$.
Let $\Li_1$ (resp. $\Li_2$) be the null geodesic generator of $\Hor_1$
(resp. $\Hor_2$) that intersects $\Sp$ at $p$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:bifur_Kill_hor}).
Since $\Sp$ is spacelike,
$\Li_1$ and $\Li_2$ are unique. By definition of a Killing horizon,
$\w{\xi}$ is tangent to $\Li_1\cap\Hor_1^+$ and to $\Li_1\cap\Hor_1^-$,
i.e. to $\Li_1\setminus\{p\}$.
If $\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p \not=0$, then by continuity,
$\w{\xi}$ is a (non-vanishing) tangent vector field all along $\Li_1$.
Similarly, $\w{\xi}$ is tangent to all $\Li_2$.
At their intersection point $p$, the geodesics $\Li_1$ and $\Li_2$ have thus a common tangent
vector, namely $\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p$.
The geodesic uniqueness theorem (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:geo:existence_uniqueness} in Appendix~\ref{s:geo})
yields then $\Li_1 = \Li_2$.
Then $\Li_1 \subset \Hor_1 \cap \Hor_2 = \Sp$. But since $\Sp$ is spacelike and
$\Li_1$ is null, we reach a contradiction. Hence we must have
$\left.\w{\xi}\right| _p = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{r:sta:zero_Killing}
Having a Killing vector field that vanishes somewhere (here $\Sp$) is not the sign
of any pathology: it simply means that the points of $\Sp$ are fixed points of
the isometries generated by $\w{\xi}$, since
setting $\w{\xi}=0$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:xi_dxdt}) leads to $\D\w{x}=0$, i.e.
to $\Phi_{\D t}(p) = p$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Contrary to what the name may suggest, a bifurcate Killing horizon is \emph{not}
a Killing horizon, for the latter, as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:def_Killing_hor},
is a regular (i.e. embedded) hypersurface
of $\M$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:embed} in Appendix~\ref{s:bas}), while
the union of two hypersurfaces is not in general a hypersurface. Moreover
on a Killing horizon, the Killing vector field is nowhere vanishing
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{s:neh:xi_on_KH})], while on
a bifurcate Killing horizon, it is vanishing at the bifurcation surface.

\begin{example}[bifurcate Killing horizon w.r.t. Lorentz boost]
\label{x:sta:bif-KH-boost}
Let us consider the boost Killing vector in Minkowski spacetime as given
by Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:boost-Killing}): $\w{\xi} := x \wpar_t + t \wpar_x$
and let us take for $\Hor_1$ the null hyperplane of equation $t=x$
considered in Example~\ref{x:neh:boostKH} in Chap.~\ref{s:neh} and denoted there
by $\Hor$. The two half-hyperplanes defined by
Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:boost-Killing_hor}) are then the Killing horizons $\Hor_1^+$ and
$\Hor_1^-$. The union $\Hor_1 \cup \Hor_2$, where $\Hor_2$ is the null hyperplane of equation $t=-x$ is a bifurcate Killing horizon with respect to $\w{\xi}$,
with the 2-plane of equation $t=0$ and $x=0$ as bifurcation surface
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:hplane_bifur}). Note that on $\Hor_1$, the Killing vector
$\w{\xi}$ points away from $\Sp$, while on $\Hor_2$, it points towards $\Sp$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Non-degenerate Killing horizons and Boyer theorem}
\label{s:sta:non-degenerate_KH}

Let us consider a Killing horizon $\Hor$ with respect to some Killing vector
field $\w{\xi}$. As shown in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:zeroth_law},
modulo some mild energy condition (the null dominant energy condition),
the surface gravity\index{surface!gravity} of $\Hor$, i.e.
the non-affinity coefficient\index{non-affinity coefficient} $\kappa$ of $\w{\xi}$ on $\Hor$,
is constant over
$\Hor$ (the zeroth law of black hole mechanics\index{zeroth law}).
In what follows, we consider the case where $\kappa\not=0$, i.e. $\Hor$
is a non-degenerate Killing horizon (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:classif_KH}).

Let us assume that $\w{\xi}$ is future-directed on $\Hor$; if not, we can
always consider $\Hor$ as a Killing horizon with respect to $-\w{\xi}$.
Let $t$ be the parameter
associated with $\w{\xi}$ along the null geodesic generators of $\Hor$, i.e.
$\w{\xi} = \D/\D t$ along any null geodesic generator $\Li$.
Since $\kappa\not=0$, $t$ is not an affine parameter of $\Li$.
The null vector field $\wl$ defined on $\Hor$ by
\be \label{e:sta:el_kappa_xi}
    \wl = \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \, \w{\xi} \quad \iff\quad
    \w{\xi} = \mathrm{e}^{\kappa t} \, \wl
\ee
is a geodesic vector field and the affine parameter associated with it is
\be \label{e:sta:lambda_t}
    \lambda = \frac{\mathrm{e}^{\kappa t}}{\kappa} + \lambda_0 ,
\ee
where $\lambda_0$ is some constant.
\begin{proof}
We have
\[
\wnab_{\wl}\, \wl = \wnab_{\mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \w{\xi}} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \, \w{\xi} \right) = \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \wnab_{\w{\xi}} \left( \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \, \w{\xi} \right)
= \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \big[ \big( \underbrace{\wnab_{\w{\xi}} \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t}}_{\D \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t}/\D t} \big) \w{\xi}
    + \mathrm{e}^{-\kappa t} \underbrace{\wnab_{\w{\xi}}\, \w{\xi}}_{\kappa\w{\xi}}
    \big] = 0 .
\]
Hence $\wl$ is a geodesic vector. Besides, along any null generator of $\Hor$,
one has [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:def_vector})]
\[
    \w{\xi}(\lambda) = \frac{\D\lambda}{\D t} = \mathrm{e}^{\kappa t}
    \underbrace{\wl(\lambda)}_{1} = \mathrm{e}^{\kappa t} ,
\]
which yields Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:lambda_t}).
\end{proof}
Let us assume $\kappa>0$. Let $\Li$ be a null geodesic generator of the Killing
horizon $\Hor$. $\Li$ can be parameterized by $t$, the corresponding
tangent vector being $\w{\xi}$. When $t$ spans the whole interval $(-\infty,+\infty)$,
Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:lambda_t}) implies that $\lambda$ spans the
interval $(\lambda_0,+\infty)$ only. Since $\lambda$ is an affine parameter of $\Li$,
this means that $\Li$ is an \emph{incomplete} geodesic\index{incomplete geodesic}\index{geodesic!incomplete --} (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:geo:existence_uniqueness}).
Moreover, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:el_kappa_xi}) leads to
\be \label{e:sta:xi_zero_t_inf}
    \w{\xi} \rightarrow 0 \quad\mbox{when}\quad t\rightarrow -\infty \qquad (\kappa>0).
\ee
In other words, the Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$ vanishes and
the null geodesic $\Li$ stops at the ``edge'' of $\Hor$ corresponding to
$t\rightarrow -\infty$.
If there is no obstacle (spacetime singularity or spacetime edge\footnote{A spacetime edge is generally not a genuine obstacle for extending an incomplete geodesic: it simply indicates
that the spacetime itself needs to be extended so that the geodesic becomes complete.}),
$\Li$ can be
extended to $\lambda\in(-\infty,\lambda_0]$, giving rise to a complete
null geodesic $\tilde\Li$. This operation can be performed for all the
null geodesic generators of $\Hor$ and we have the freedom to choose the same value
of $\lambda_0$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:lambda_t}) for all of them. In this process,
one gives birth to a null hypersurface, $\tilde\Hor$ say, which contains $\Hor$. Let $\Sp\subset\tilde\Hor$ be the set of points of
affine parameter $\lambda=\lambda_0$ along all the extended null geodesics
$\tilde\Li$. $\Sp$ is clearly a cross-section of $\tilde\Hor$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}); it is then a
spacelike $(n-2)$-dimensional surface.
$\Sp$ constitutes the past boundary of $\Hor$, i.e. the boundary corresponding to $t\rightarrow -\infty$.
Since $\w{\xi}$ is a smooth vector field on $\M$, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:xi_zero_t_inf})
implies that $\w{\xi}$ vanishes on $\Sp$.
In other words, $\Sp$ is a set of fixed points for the isometry group generated
by $\w{\xi}$ (cf. Remark~\ref{r:sta:zero_Killing} above).
Let us denote by $\Hor^-$ the subset of $\tilde\Hor$
generated by the segments $\lambda<\lambda_0$ of the null geodesics $\tilde\Li$:
$\Hor^- = \tilde\Hor\setminus(\Hor\cup\Sp)$.
$\Hor^-$ is clearly a null hypersurface.
Since $\Sp$ is spacelike and $(n-2)$-dimensional, there are, at each point
$p\in\Sp$, only two null directions normal to $\Sp$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}). One of them is along $\wl$. The set of all null geodesics
departing from $\Sp$ along the other null direction forms a null hypersurface,
$\Hor_2^+$ say, in the future of $\Sp$ and another null hypersurface, $\Hor_2^-$
say, in the past of $\Sp$.
By studying the behaviour of a Killing vector field around the set of its
fixed points (here $\Sp$), Boyer \cite{Boyer69} has shown that in
the current setting (i.e. $\Sp$ spacelike), $\w{\xi}$ acts \emph{locally}
as the generator of Lorentz boosts in Minkowski spacetime and $\Sp$ is the bifurcation surface
of a bifurcate Killing horizon similar to that of Example~\ref{x:sta:bif-KH-boost}
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:hplane_bifur}).
More precisely, Boyer proved the following theorem:

\begin{prop}[Boyer's theorem \cite{Boyer69}]
A Killing horizon $\Hor$ is contained in a bifurcate Killing horizon if and
only if $\Hor$ contains at least one incomplete, extendable, null geodesic
generator.
\end{prop}

That $\Hor$ contains an incomplete geodesic is guaranteed by
$\kappa\not=0$, as we have just seen.
It follows that $\Hor^-$, $\Hor_2^+$ and $\Hor_2^-$
are three Killing horizons, so that $\Hor\cup\Hor^-\cup\Hor_2^+\cup\Hor_2^-\cup\Sp$
is a bifurcate Killing horizon.

If $\kappa<0$, we see from Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:lambda_t}) that while $t$ spans the
whole interval $(-\infty,+\infty)$, the affine parameter $\lambda$ spans the
interval $(-\infty,\lambda_0)$ only. Moreover, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:el_kappa_xi})
leads to
\be
    \w{\xi} \rightarrow 0 \quad\mbox{when}\quad t\rightarrow +\infty  \qquad (\kappa<0).
\ee
The reasoning developed for $\kappa>0$ can be applied mutatis mutandis,
leading to a bifurcate Killing horizon with a bifurcation surface $\Sp$ that
is the future boundary of $\Hor$. Hence we conclude:
\begin{prop}[non-degenerate Killing horizons and bifurcate Killing horizons]
\label{p:sta:non_degen_bifurcate}
The null geodesic generators of a non-degenerate Killing horizon $\Hor$ are
incomplete; if they can be extended, $\Hor$ is contained in a
bifurcate Killing horizon, the bifurcation surface of which is the past
(resp. future) boundary of $\Hor$ if $\kappa>0$ (resp. $\kappa<0$).
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
\label{r:sta:extension_bifurcate}
It could be that the generators of $\Hor$ cannot be extended simply
because the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is not been chosen ``large enough''.
I.~R\'acz\index{Racz, I.@R\'acz, I.} and R.M.~Wald\index{Wald, R.M.} \cite{RaczW96}
have shown that under some mild hypotheses (in particular that $(\M,\w{g})$ is globally
hyperbolic), one can extend $(\M,\w{g})$ to a larger spacetime with a bifurcate
Killing horizon containing $\Hor$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
For a degenerate Killing horizon, the problem of extension disappears, since
$t$ is then an affine parameter of the null generators. Consequently if $t$ spans
the whole interval $(-\infty,\infty)$, the null generators are complete
geodesics. One can still have $\w{\xi}\rightarrow 0$ at some boundary
of $\Hor$, but this is a null boundary, not a spacelike one, and it does not
correspond to a bifurcation surface. An example is the Killing horizon with
respect to a null-rotation Killing vector in Minkowski spacetime, exhibited
as Examples~\ref{x:neh:nullrotKH} and \ref{x:neh:nullrotKH_kappa}
in Chap.~\ref{s:neh}, p.~\pageref{x:neh:nullrotKH} and \pageref{x:neh:nullrotKH_kappa}
respectively (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:neh:hplaneKilling-nullrot}): $\w{\xi}=0$
on the null 2-plane of equation $t=x$, $y=0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{hist} \label{h:sta:Boyer}
The concept of bifurcate Killing horizons has been introduced by Robert H. Boyer\index{Boyer, R.H.}
(1932-1966), a young American mathematical physicist just appointed to the University
of Liverpool. Sadly, Boyer was killed, among 14 victims, in a mass murder that
occurred in the University of Texas at Austin on 1 August 1966.
His last notes, containing the definition of a bifurcate Killing horizon
and the proof of the above theorem, have been turned into an article
by J. Ehlers\index{Ehlers, J.} and J.L. Stachel\index{Stachel, J.L.} and published in 1969 \cite{Boyer69}.

\section{Mass and angular momentum}

For an asymptotically flat stationary spacetime, containing a
black hole or not, there is a well-defined concept of mass: the \emph{Komar mass},
which we introduce here (Secs.~\ref{s:sta:Komar_mass} and \ref{s:sta:Komar_ADM}).
For axisymmetric spacetimes, which are relevant
for stationary rotating black holes, there is in addition the concept
of \emph{Komar angular momentum}, which we shall introduce in Sec.~\ref{s:sta:Komar_angu_mom}.

\subsection{Komar mass} \label{s:sta:Komar_mass}

Let $(\M, \w{g})$ be an asymptotically flat spacetime of dimension $n \geq 4$
that is stationary,
with stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$.
Given a spacelike closed $(n-2)$-surface $\Sp\subset\M$,
the \defin{Komar mass over}\index{Komar!mass}\index{mass!Komar --} $\Sp$ is
defined by
\be  \label{e:sta:def_Komar_mass}
    \encadre{M_{\Sp} := - \frac{n-2}{16\pi(n-3)} \int_{\Sp} \star(\dd \uu{\xi}) },
\ee
where
(i) $\uu{\xi}$ is the 1-form associated to $\w{\xi}$
by metric duality (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:metric_dual}), i.e. the 1-form
of components $\xi_\alpha = g_{\alpha\mu} \xi^\mu$, (ii) $\dd \uu{\xi}$ is
the exterior derivative of $\uu{\xi}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:ext_deriv}, especially Eqs.~(\ref{e:bas:def_ext_1f}) and (\ref{e:bas:def_ext_1f_nab})):
\be \label{e:sta:duxi_nab}
    (\dd \uu{\xi})_{\alpha\beta} =
        \partial_\alpha \xi_\beta - \partial_\beta \xi_\alpha =
        \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta - \nabla_\beta \xi_\alpha
        = 2 \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta ,
\ee
the last equality following from Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}),
and (iii) $\star(\dd \uu{\xi})$ is the $(n-2)$-form that is the
Hodge dual of the 2-form $\dd \uu{\xi}$. The
\defin{Hodge dual}\index{Hodge dual}\index{dual!Hodge --} of
any 2-form $\w{A}$ is defined\footnote{See e.g. Sec.~14.5 of
Ref.~\cite{Gourg13} for an introduction to Hodge duality for $n=4$.}
as the $(n-2)$-form $\star\w{A}$ given by
\be \label{e:sta:Hodge_2form}
    \star\! A_{\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{n-2}} := \frac{1}{2}
        A_{\mu\nu} \, \epsilon^{\mu\nu}_{\ \ \; \alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{n-2}} ,
\ee
where
$\w{\epsilon}$ is the Levi-Civita tensor associated with the metric $\w{g}$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:Levi-Civita_tensor}).

\begin{remark}
\label{r:sta:Komar_well_posed}
As the integral of a $(n-2)$-form over a $(n-2)$-dimensional manifold, formula
(\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass}) is well posed. More precisely, on the $(n-2)$-dimensional
manifold $\Sp$, the theory of integration is defined for $(n-2)$-forms \emph{on} $\Sp$,
while $\star(\dd \uu{\xi})$ is a $(n-2)$-form \emph{on} $\M$. However, any
$(n-2)$-form $\w{\omega}$ on $\M$ yields canonically to a unique $(n-2)$-form
$\iota^* \w{\omega}$ on the
submanifold $\Sp$, by restricting the action of $\w{\omega}$ at each point
$p\in\Sp$ to vectors tangent to $\Sp$. One says that $\iota^* \w{\omega}$ is the
\emph{pullback}\index{pullback} of $\w{\omega}$ to $\Sp$ via the embedding $\iota$ of $\Sp$ in $\M$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:bas:Lie}).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
For $n=4$ (the standard spacetime dimension), the numerical prefactor in front of
the integral in the definition (\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass}) is $-1/(8\pi)$.
For $n=5$, it becomes $-3/(32\pi)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The Komar mass is not defined for $n \leq 3$. In particular,
formula~(\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass}) is ill-posed for $n=3$.
Already in Newtonian gravity, the very concept of gravitational mass is well defined only
for $n \geq 4$. Indeed, in spherical symmetry,
a solution of the Poisson equation\index{Poisson equation} outside the sources ($\Delta \Phi = 0$)
that decays with the radius $r$ exists only for $n \geq 4$: this solution is\footnote{This is easy
to get since in an Euclidean space of dimension $n-1$ the Laplace
operator\index{Laplace operator} is $\Delta\Phi = \frac{1}{r^{n-2}} \derd{}{r} \left( r^{n-2} \derd{\Phi}{r} \right)$
for spherically symmetric fields $\Phi(r)$.}
$\Phi = -M/r^{n-3}$,
where the constant $M$ is interpreted as the \emph{gravitational mass}\index{gravitational!mass}\index{mass!gravitational --} of the central source.
For $n=3$, the solutions of $\Delta \Phi = 0$ are $\Phi = a \ln r + b$ ($a$ and $b$ being constant), while
for $n=2$, they are $\Phi = a r + b$, none of them decaying for $r\to +\infty$.
The prefactor $-(n-2)/(16\pi(n-3))$ in the definition (\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass})
is chosen to recover the gravitational mass at the Newtonian limit, as
it will be explictly shown for $n=4$ in Example~\ref{x:sta:Komar_mass_star} below.
\end{remark}

In view of Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Hodge_2form}) and the last equality in Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:duxi_nab}),
the Komar mass formula (\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass}) can be written as
\be \label{e:sta:def_Komar_mass_alt}
    M_{\Sp} = - \frac{n-2}{16\pi(n-3)}  \int_{\Sp}  \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu \,
    \epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{n-2}} ,
\ee
where $\nabla^\mu \xi^\nu \, \epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{n-2}}$
stands for the $(n-2)$-form $\w{\omega}$ defined by
\[
  \w{\omega}(\w{u}_1,\ldots,\w{u}_{n-2}) = \nabla^\mu \xi^\nu \,
\epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{n-2}} u_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots  u_{n-2}^{\alpha_{n-2}}
\]
for any $(n-2)$-tuple of vector fields $(\w{u}_1,\ldots,\w{u}_{n-2})$ tangent to $\Sp$ (cf. Remark~\ref{r:sta:Komar_well_posed} above).

Instead of integrals of $(n-2)$-forms \emph{along} the $(n-2)$-surface $\Sp$, as in (\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass})
and (\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass_alt}), one may
express the Komar mass as a \emph{flux integral}\index{flux!integral}\index{integral!flux --}, i.e. the integral of a 2-form
contracted with some ``area element'', which is \emph{normal} to $\Sp$.
More precisely, let us introduce the
\defin{normal area element bivector}\index{normal!area!element}\index{bivector!normal area element --}\index{area!normal -- element} by
\be \label{e:sta:area_bivector}
    \D S^{\alpha\beta} := (s^\alpha n^\beta - n^\alpha s^\beta) \sqrt{q}\, \D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-2} ,
\ee
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\w{n}$ is a unit future-directed timelike vector\footnote{Do not confuse the vector $\w{n}$
with the spacetime dimension $n$.} normal to $\Sp$
and $\w{s}$ is a unit spacelike vector normal to $\Sp$
such that (i) $\w{s}$ points towards the ``exterior'' of $\Sp$, i.e.
towards the asymptotically flat end of $(\M, \w{g})$ and
(ii) at each point $p\in\Sp$, $(\w{n},\w{s})$ is an orthonormal basis
of the timelike plane $T^\perp_p\Sp$ normal to $\Sp$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:def:TS_ortho},
which holds for any spacelike closed $(n-2)$-surface $\Sp$);
\item $(x^a)=(x^1,\ldots,x^{n-2})$ is a coordinate system on $\Sp$
such that $(\w{n},\w{s},\wpar_1,\ldots,\wpar_{n-2})$ is a right-handed basis,
i.e. $\w{\eps}(\w{n},\w{s},\wpar_1,\ldots,\wpar_{n-2}) > 0$;
\item $q := \det(q_{ab})$ is the determinant w.r.t. $(x^a)$ of
the metric $\w{q}$
induced on $\Sp$ by the spacetime metric $\w{g}$, so that
$\sqrt{q}\, \D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-2}$ is the area element on $\Sp$.
\end{itemize}
To reexpress the Komar mass, we shall use the following identity:\\
\begin{lemma}[Flux integral of a 2-form]
\label{p:sta:flux_integ_2form}
For any 2-form $\w{A}$ defined in the vicinity of $\Sp$, one has
\be \label{e:sta:int_star_A}
    \int_{\Sp} \star \w{A} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Sp} A_{\mu\nu} \, \D S^{\mu\nu} ,
\ee
where the $(n-2)$-form $\star\w{A}$ is the Hodge dual of $\w{A}$, as
defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Hodge_2form}).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Using the definition (\ref{e:sta:Hodge_2form}), we have
\[
    \int_{\Sp} \star \w{A} =
        \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Sp} A^{\mu\nu} \,
        \epsilon^{\mu\nu}_{\ \ \; \alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{n-2}} =
         \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Sp} \w{A}^\sharp (\w{e}^{(\mu)}, \w{e}^{(\nu)})
                \, \w{\epsilon}(\w{e}_{(\mu)}, \w{e}_{(\nu)}, \D\w{\ell}_{1},
                    \ldots, \D\w{\ell}_{n-2}) ,
\]
where $\w{A}^\sharp$ is the tensor field of components $A^{\alpha\beta}$,
$(\w{e}_{(\alpha)})$ is an orthonormal tetrad such that
$\w{e}_{(0)} = \w{n}$ and $\w{e}_{(1)} = \w{s}$,
$(\w{e}^{(\alpha)})$ is its dual cobasis and $\D\w{\ell}_{1}$, $\ldots$, $\D\w{\ell}_{n-2}$
are displacement vectors forming elementary parallelograms on $\Sp$; for instance
$\D\w{\ell}_{a} = \D x^a \, \wpar_a$ for $a\in\{1, \ldots, n-2\}$.
Note that the last equality in the above expression results from the very
definition of the integral of a $(n-2)$-form on a $(n-2)$-surface.
Given the definition of the tetrad $(\w{e}_{(\alpha)})$, $(\w{e}_{(2)}, \ldots, \w{e}_{(n-1)})$
is necessarily a basis of the tangent space $T_p\Sp$; consequently
$\D\w{\ell}_{1}$, $\ldots$, $\D\w{\ell}_{n-2}$ are linear combinations of $\w{e}_{(2)}$,
$\ldots$, $\w{e}_{(n-1)}$. Given the alternate character of $\w{\epsilon}$,
we may then restrict the sum over the indices $\mu$ and $\nu$ to
$(\mu,\nu) = (0,1)$ and $(\mu,\nu) = (1,0)$.
Hence
\[
     \int_{\Sp} \star \w{A}
     = \int_{\Sp}
    \w{A}^\sharp (\w{e}^{(0)}, \w{e}^{(1)})
            \, \w{\epsilon}(\w{e}_{(0)}, \w{e}_{(1)}, \D\w{\ell}_{1}, \ldots , \D\w{\ell}_{n-2})
    =  \int_{\Sp} A^{(0)(1)}
    \, \w{\epsilon}(\w{n}, \w{s}, \D\w{\ell}_{1}, \ldots , \D\w{\ell}_{n-2}) .
\]
Now, since $(\w{e}_{(\alpha)})$ is an orthonormal basis,
\[
  A^{(0)(1)} = g^{(0)(\mu)} g^{(1)(\nu)} A_{(\mu)(\nu)} = g^{(0)(0)} g^{(1)(1)}
    A_{(0)(1)} = (-1)\times 1 \times A_{(0)(1)} = - A_{(0)(1)} ,
\]
with
\[
    A_{(0)(1)} = \w{A}(\w{e}_{(0)}, \w{e}_{(1)}) = \w{A}(\w{n}, \w{s})
        = A_{\mu\nu} n^\mu s^\nu = - A_{\mu\nu} s^\mu n^\nu
        = - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu\nu} (s^\mu n^\nu - n^\mu s^\nu) .
\]
On the other side, we recognize in ${}^\Sp\!\!\w{\epsilon} := \w{\epsilon}(\w{n}, \w{s}, \ldots)$ the
``area'' element $(n-2)$-form on $\Sp$ (see e.g. Sec.~16.4.3 of Ref.~\cite{Gourg13}),
so that we may write, for
$\D\w{\ell}_{a} = \D x^a \, \wpar_a$,
\[
    \w{\epsilon}(\w{n}, \w{s}, \D\w{\ell}_{1}, \ldots , \D\w{\ell}_{n-2}) =
        {}^\Sp\!\!\epsilon_{a_1\ldots a_{n-2}} \, \D\ell_{1}^{a_1}\cdots  \D\ell_{n-2}^{a_{n-2}}
        = \sqrt{q} \, \D x^1 \cdots  \D x^{n-2} .
\]
Gathering the above results and using Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:area_bivector})
establishes Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:int_star_A}).
\end{proof}

Thanks to Lemma~\ref{p:sta:flux_integ_2form}, we may reexpress the Komar mass
(\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass}) as
\be \label{e:sta:M_Komar_dS}
   M_{\Sp} = - \frac{n-2}{32\pi(n-3)}  \int_{\Sp} (\dd \uu{\xi})_{\mu\nu} \,  \D S^{\mu\nu} .
\ee
Using the last equality in Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:duxi_nab}), this becomes
\be \label{e:sta:Komar_mass_flux_nabla_xi}
    \encadre{ M_{\Sp} = - \frac{n-2}{16\pi(n-3)} \int_{\Sp} \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu \,  \D S^{\mu\nu} } .
\ee
Alternatively, we may express the exterior derivative in terms of
partial derivatives (first equality in Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:duxi_nab})) and get
\[
    (\dd \uu{\xi})_{\mu\nu} \,  \D S^{\mu\nu} =
    (\partial_\mu \xi_\nu - \partial_\nu \xi_\mu)
    (s^\mu n^\nu - n^\mu s^\nu) \sqrt{q}\, \D^{n-2} x
    = 2 \partial_\mu \xi_\nu  (s^\mu  n^\nu - n^\mu  s^\nu)
    \sqrt{q}\, \D^{n-2} x  .
\]
Equation~(\ref{e:sta:M_Komar_dS}) yields then an expression of $M_{\Sp}$ that
can be used for explicit computations:
\be \label{e:sta:M_Komar_partial_der}
    \encadre{ M_{\Sp} = -\frac{n-2}{16\pi(n-3)}
    \int_{\Sp} \partial_\mu \xi_\nu (s^\mu   n^\nu - n^\mu s^\nu)
    \sqrt{q}\,  \D x^1 \cdots  \D x^{n-2} } .
\ee

\begin{example}[Komar mass in Schwarzschild spacetime]
\label{x:sta:Komar_mass_Schw}
Let us consider the Schwarzschild spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$
introduced in
Example~\ref{x:def:Schw_hor} of Sec.~\ref{s:def:geom_null_hypsurf}.
In terms of the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ used there,
the stationary Killing vector is simply $\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$.
We have $n=4$ and let us choose $\Sp$ to be a 2-sphere defined by $(t,r) = \mathrm{const}$.
The coordinates $(x^a) = (x^1, x^2)$ spanning $\Sp$ are then $(\th,\ph)$.
For the pair of normal vectors to $\Sp$, we choose
$\w{n} = N^{-1} \wpar_t  - 2mN/r \wpar_r$ and $\w{s} = N \wpar_r$, where
$N := (1 + 2m/r)^{-1/2}$. Given the metric (\ref{e:def:Schw_metric}), it is
easy to check that
$\w{g}(\w{n},\w{n}) = -1$, $\w{g}(\w{n},\w{s}) = 0$ and $\w{g}(\w{s},\w{s}) = 1$.
It is also immediate that $\w{g}(\w{n},\wpar_\th) = \w{g}(\w{n},\wpar_\ph) =  0$ and
$\w{g}(\w{s},\wpar_\th) = \w{g}(\w{s},\wpar_\ph) =  0$,
which proves that $\w{n}$ and $\w{s}$ are normal to $\Sp$.
Moreover, $\w{s}$ points towards the exterior of $\Sp$ (since $N>0$) and
$(\w{n},\w{s},\wpar_\th,\wpar_\ph)$ is a right-handed basis. All the hypotheses
stated below Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:area_bivector}) are thus fulfilled and we may use
Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:M_Komar_partial_der}) to evaluate the Komar mass over $\Sp$.
The components $\xi_\alpha$ of $\uu{\xi}$ are easily evaluated via
the components (\ref{e:def:Schw_metric}) of $\w{g}$:
$\xi_\alpha = g_{\alpha\mu} \xi^\nu = g_{\alpha\mu} (\partial_t)^\mu = g_{\alpha t}
= (-1 + 2m/r, 2m/r, 0, 0)$.
The only non-zero derivatives $\partial_\mu\xi_\nu$
are then $\partial_r \xi_t$ and $\partial_r \xi_r$; they are both equal to $-2m/r^2$.
It follows that the integrand in Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:M_Komar_partial_der}) is reduced to only two terms:
\[
  \partial_\mu \xi_\nu (s^\mu   n^\nu - n^\mu s^\nu) =
  \partial_r \xi_t (s^r n^t - n^r s^t) = - \frac{2m}{r^2}
  \left( N \times N^{-1}  + 2m N\times 0 \right) = - \frac{2m}{r^2} .
\]
We read on Eq.~(\ref{e:def:Schw_metric}) that the metric induced on
$\Sp$ is $\w{q} = r^2 \, \dd\th^2 + r^2 \sin^2\, \th \dd\ph^2$, so that $\sqrt{q} = r^2 \sin\th$.
Accordingly, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:M_Komar_partial_der}) leads to
\[
    M_{\Sp} = -\frac{1}{8\pi} \int_{\Sp} \left( - \frac{2m}{r^2} \right)
    r^2 \sin\th \, \D\th \, \D\ph = \frac{m}{4\pi} \int_{\Sp} \D\th \, \D\ph .
\]
Since the remaining integral is nothing but $4\pi$, we get simply
\be
    M_{\Sp} = m.
\ee
We note that $M_{\Sp}$ does not depend on $r$, i.e. does not depend on the
choice of the sphere $\Sp$.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Volume integral formula for the Komar mass}

We are going to derive a volume integral formula for $M_{\Sp}$, from which one can show
the independence of $M_{\Sp}$ from the choice of $\Sp$ in
the vacuum case, thereby generalizing the result of Example~\ref{x:sta:Komar_mass_Schw}.
To this aim, we shall make use of the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}[flux integral of the divergence of a 2-form]
\label{p:sta:flux_div_2_form}
In a $n$-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime $(\M, \w{g})$,
let $\Sigma$ be a compact spacelike hypersurface bounded by two closed $(n-2)$-surfaces:
an ``internal'' one, $\Sp_{\rm int}$, and an ``external'' one,
$\Sp_{\rm ext}$, the exterior direction being that of the asymptotic flat end of $(\M, \w{g})$.
Let $\w{n}$ be the future-directed unit normal to $\Sigma$ and $\D\w{V}$
the \defin{normal volume element vector}\index{normal!volume!element}\index{volume!normal -- element}
of $\Sigma$ defined by [compare Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:area_bivector})]:
\be \label{e:sta:normal_vol_element}
    \D V^\alpha := - n^\alpha \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-1} ,
\ee
where $(x^1, \ldots, x^{n-1})$ stands for a coordinate system on $\Sigma$ and
$\gamma := \det (\gamma_{ij})$  is the determinant w.r.t. these coordinates of the metric
$\w{\gamma}$ induced on $\Sigma$ by the spacetime metric $\w{g}$, so that
$\sqrt{\gamma}\, \D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-1}$ is the volume element on $\Sigma$.
Then, for any 2-form $\w{A}$, we have
\be \label{e:sta:flux_div_2form}
    2 \int_{\Sigma} \nabla^\nu A_{\mu\nu} \, \D V^\mu
    = \int_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} A_{\mu\nu} \, \D S^{\mu\nu}
      - \int_{\Sp_{\rm int}} A_{\mu\nu} \, \D S^{\mu\nu} ,
\ee
where $\D S^{\mu\nu}$
is defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:area_bivector}) with $\w{s}$ pointing to the
exterior for both $\Sp_{\rm ext}$ and $\Sp_{\rm int}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $(t,x^1, \ldots, x^{n-1})$ be a local coordinate system adapted to $\Sigma$,
i.e. such that $\Sigma$ is the hypersurface $t=0$, and let $\w{V}$
be the vector defined by $\uu{V} := \w{A}(., \w{n})$, i.e.
$V_\alpha := A_{\alpha\mu} n^\mu$. Thanks to the antisymmetry of $\w{A}$,
$\w{V}$ is tangent to $\Sigma$: $\w{n}\cdot\w{V} = \w{A}(\w{n},\w{n}) = 0$.
We have then, using the antisymmetry of $\w{A}$,
\bea
    \nabla^\nu A_{\mu\nu} \, \D V^\mu &= & \nabla^\nu A_{\nu\mu} \, n^\mu \sqrt{\gamma} \,  \D^{n-1} x
    = \left( \nabla^\nu V_\nu - A_{\nu\mu} \nabla^\nu n^\mu \right) \sqrt{\gamma} \,  \D^{n-1} x
        \nonumber \\
   & = &
   ( \nabla_\mu V^\mu  + \underbrace{A_{\nu\mu} K^{\nu\mu}}_{0}
    + \underbrace{A_{\nu\mu} n^\nu}_{-V_\mu} D^\mu \ln N ) \sqrt{\gamma} \,  \D^{n-1} x
    \nonumber \\
  & = & \left( \nabla_\mu V^\mu - V^i \partial_i \ln N \right) \sqrt{\gamma} \,  \D^{n-1} x . \nonumber
\eea
In the second line, we have expressed the derivative of $\w{n}$ in terms of the
extrinsic curvature\index{extrinsic curvature}\index{curvature!extrinsic --}
tensor $\w{K}$ of $\Sigma$ and of the lapse function $N := - \w{n} \cdot \wpar_t$,
via the identity $\nabla^\alpha n^\beta = - K^{\alpha\beta} - D^\beta\ln N n^\alpha$
(see e.g. Eq.~(4.24) of Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}), where $D^\beta \ln N = \nabla^\beta \ln N + n^\beta n^\mu \nabla_\mu \ln N$. To get the third line, we have used the symmetry of $\w{K}$
to set $A_{\nu\mu} K^{\nu\mu} = 0$ and the property $V_\mu n^\mu = 0$
to write $V_\mu D^\mu \ln N = V_\mu \nabla^\mu \ln N = V^\mu \partial_\mu \ln N
= V^i\partial_i \ln N$ ($i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$).
Let us now use formula (\ref{e:bas:div_vect}) for the divergence of $\w{V}$,
along with $V^0 = 0$ ($\w{V}$ is tangent to $\Sigma$) and
the relation $\sqrt{-g} = N\sqrt{\gamma}$ between the determinants
of the metrics $\w{g}$ and $\w{\gamma}$ (see e.g. Eq.~(5.55) of Ref.~\cite{Gourg12})
\bea
    \nabla_\mu V^\mu  & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \partial_\mu \left( \sqrt{-g} V^\mu \right)
    = \frac{1}{N \sqrt{\gamma}} \partial_i \left( N \sqrt{\gamma} V^i \right) \nonumber \\
    & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}} \partial_i \left( \sqrt{\gamma} V^i \right)
      + V^i \partial_i \ln N
    = D_i V^i + V^i \partial_i \ln N  ,  \nonumber
\eea
where $D_i V^i$ is the divergence of $\w{V}$ considered as a vector field
on $(\Sigma, \w{\gamma})$, $\w{D}$ standing for the Levi-Civita connection
of $\w{\gamma}$. Hence we get
\[
   \nabla^\nu A_{\mu\nu} \, \D V^\mu = D_i V^i  \sqrt{\gamma}  \, \D^{n-1} x.
\]
We may then apply the Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem to $\w{V}$
and write the integral of the divergence of $\w{A}$ as
\bea
    \int_{\Sigma} \nabla^\nu A_{\mu\nu} \, \D V^\mu & = &
    \int_{\Sigma}  D_i V^i  \sqrt{\gamma}  \, \D^{n-1} x =
    \int_{\partial\Sigma} \sigma^i V_i \sqrt{q} \, d^{n-2} x \nonumber \\
    & =  &  \int_{\Sp_{\rm ext}}\!\! s^i V_i \sqrt{q} \, d^{n-2} x
        - \int_{\Sp_{\rm int}} \!\! s^i V_i \sqrt{q} \, d^{n-2} x , \nonumber
\eea
where $\w{\sigma}$ is the unit vector normal to the boundary $\partial\Sigma$,
oriented towards the exterior of $\Sigma$. In the present case, $\partial\Sigma$
has two connected components: $\Sp_{\rm int}$ and $\Sp_{\rm ext}$, with
$\w{\sigma} = - \w{s}$ on $\Sp_{\rm int}$ and $\w{\sigma} = \w{s}$ on $\Sp_{\rm ext}$,
hence the last equality.
Now, using again the antisymmetry of $\w{A}$,
\[
   s^i V_i = s^\mu V_\mu = s^\mu A_{\mu\nu} n^\nu = \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu\nu}
   (s^\mu n^\nu - n^\mu s^\nu) .
\]
In view of expression (\ref{e:sta:area_bivector}) for $\D S^{\mu\nu}$, we
thus get $2 s^i V_i \sqrt{q} \, \D^{n-2} x = A_{\mu\nu} \D S^{\mu\nu}$, so
that Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:flux_div_2form}) follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Volume integral formula for the Komar mass]
\label{p:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ}
Let $(\M, \w{g})$ be an asymptotically flat stationary $n$-dimensional spacetime,
with stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$. Let us assume that $\w{g}$
obeys the Einstein equation (\ref{e:fra:Einstein_eq}) with some energy-momentum
tensor $\w{T}$ and a vanishing cosmological constant.
Let $\Sigma$ be a compact spacelike hypersurface bounded by two closed $(n-2)$-surfaces:
an ``internal'' one, $\Sp_{\rm int}$, and an ``external'' one,
$\Sp_{\rm ext}$, the exterior direction being that of the asymptotic flat end of $(\M, \w{g})$.
The Komar masses over $\Sp_{\rm ext}$ and $\Sp_{\rm int}$ are then
related by
\be \label{e:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ}
    \encadre{ M_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} = M_{\Sp_{\rm int}} + 2
    \int_{\Sigma} \left( \w{T}(\w{n}, \w{\xi}) - \frac{T}{n-2} \, \w{n}\cdot \w{\xi} \right)
    \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-1}  , }
\ee
where $\w{n}$ is the future-directed unit normal to $\Sigma$,
$\sqrt{\gamma}\,\D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-1}$ is the volume element on $\Sigma$
induced by $\w{g}$ and $T:= \mathrm{tr}_{\w{g}} \w{T} = g^{\mu\nu} T_{\mu\nu}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let us apply Lemma~\ref{p:sta:flux_div_2_form} to $A_{\alpha\beta} := \nabla_\alpha \xi_\beta$,
which does define a 2-form thanks to the  Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}).
In the left-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:flux_div_2form}), there appears then
$\nabla^\nu \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu$. Now, the Ricci identity (\ref{e:bas:Ricci_ident})
applied to the vector field $\w{\xi}$ yields
$\nabla_\alpha \nabla_\beta \xi^\gamma - \nabla_\beta \nabla_\alpha \xi^\gamma
= R^\gamma_{\ \  \nu \alpha\beta} \, \xi^\nu$. Contracting on the indices
$\alpha$ and $\gamma$ makes the Ricci tensor $R_{\alpha\beta}$ appear:
$\nabla_\nu \nabla_\mu \xi^\nu - \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \xi^\nu = R_{\nu\mu} \xi^\nu$.
Thanks to the Killing equation (\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}), the divergence
of $\w{\xi}$ is zero: $\nabla_\nu \xi^\nu = 0$. Using the symmetry of the Ricci tensor,
we get
\[
    \nabla^\nu \nabla_\mu \xi_\nu = R_{\mu\nu} \xi^\nu .
\]
Equation~(\ref{e:sta:flux_div_2form}) yields then
\[
    2 \int_{\Sigma} R_{\mu\nu} \xi^\nu \D V^\mu =
    - 8\pi M_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} + 8\pi M_{\Sp_{\rm int}} ,
\]
where we have used Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_flux_nabla_xi})
to let appear the Komar masses $M_{\Sp_{\rm ext}}$ and $M_{\Sp_{\rm int}}$.
Finaly, making use of the Einstein equation in the form
(\ref{e:fra:Einstein_eq_n}) with $\Lambda=0$, along with expression
(\ref{e:sta:normal_vol_element}) for $\D V^\mu$, we get
Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ}).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\label{r:sta:Komar_mass_single_boundary}
If $\Sigma$ is a compact spacelike hypersurface bounded by a single closed
$(n-2)$-surface, $\Sp_{\rm ext}$ say, formula~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ})
still holds, provided that $M_{\Sp_{\rm int}}$ is replaced by zero. This follows
directly from Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:flux_div_2form}) with the integral on $\Sp_{\rm int}$
set to zero, since the boundary of $\Sigma$, which appears in the
Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem, is only made of $\Sp_{\rm ext}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[Komar mass of a static star]
\label{x:sta:Komar_mass_star}
We may use formula (\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ})
to check that at the Newtonian limit, the Komar mass over
a surface $\Sp_{\rm ext}$ surrounding a star
reduces to the volume integral of the matter mass density,
i.e. to the classical expression of the mass\index{Newtonian!mass}\index{mass!Newtonian --}
in Newtonian gravity.
To this aim, we set $n=4$ and assume that the spacetime is strictly static, i.e. that $\w{\xi}$
is timelike and hypersurface-orthogonal in all $\M$.
A static fluid star is then
defined by the energy-momentum tensor $\w{T}$ being
a perfect fluid\index{perfect fluid}\index{fluid!perfect --} one:
$\w{T} = (\rho + p)\uu{u} \otimes \uu{u} + p \w{g}$, where
$\rho$ is the fluid-comoving energy density,
$p$ is the fluid pressure and the fluid 4-velocity $\w{u}$ is collinear to the
static Killing field $\w{\xi}$:
\[
    \w{u} = \frac{1}{W} \, \w{\xi}
    \quad\mbox{with}\quad
    W := \sqrt{- \w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi} } ,
\]
the value of $W$ being imposed by the requirement $\w{u}\cdot\w{u} = -1$.
Let us choose for $\Sigma$ a hypersurface orthogonal to $\w{\xi}$
with an outer boundary  $\Sp_{\rm ext}$ but no inner boundary $\Sp_{\rm int}$.
Since $\Sigma$ is othogonal to $\w{\xi}$, we have
necessarily $\w{n} = \w{u}$, so that $\w{T}(\w{n},\w{\xi}) = W \w{T}(\w{u},\w{u})
= W \rho$ and $\w{g}(\w{n},\w{\xi}) = W \w{g}(\w{u},\w{u}) = -W$. Given that
$T = 3 p  - \rho$, formula~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ}) with
$M_{\Sp_{\rm int}} =  0$ (cf. Remark~\ref{r:sta:Komar_mass_single_boundary} above)
results in
\[
    M_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} = 2
    \int_{\Sigma} \left( W \rho - \frac{3p - \rho}{2}(-W) \right)
    \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \D x^2 \D x^3
    = \int_{\Sigma} W (\rho + 3 p) \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \D x^2 \D x^3 .
\]
Now, for a weakly relativistic star, $|p| \ll \rho$ and
 in coordinates $(t, x^i)$ such that
$\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$,
 $W = \sqrt{- \w{\xi}\cdot\w{\xi} } = \sqrt{- g_{tt}} \simeq 1 + \Phi$, where
$\Phi$ is the Newtonian gravitational potential\index{gravitational!potential},
i.e. the solution of
the Poisson equation\index{Poisson equation}
$\Delta \Phi = 4\pi \rho$ that vansihes at infinity. We may then write
\be \label{e:sta:mass_Newtonian}
    M_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} \simeq \int_{\Sigma} \rho \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \D x^2 \D x^3
    + \int_{\Sigma} \rho \Phi \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \D x^2 \D x^3 .
\ee
The first term is the volume integral of the fluid mass density; the second
term is negative (since $\Phi < 0$) and represents the \emph{total gravitational
potential energy}\index{gravitational!potential energy} of the star, or equivalently the \emph{gravitational binding energy}\index{gravitational!binding energy}\index{binding!energy}
of the star.
Its presence should not be a surprise given the mass-energy equivalence in
relativity. However, at the Newtonian limit, this
term can be
neglected in front of the first one and formula (\ref{e:sta:mass_Newtonian})
reduces to the classical expression of mass of a Newtonian body.
\end{example}

Since in vacuum $\w{T} = 0$, an immediate
corollary of Property~\ref{p:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ} is:

\begin{prop}[Independence of the Komar mass from the integration surface]
\label{p:sta:Komar_mass_invariant}
Two $(n-2)$-surfaces $\Sp_{\rm ext}$ and $\Sp_{\rm int}$ that are connected by
a spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma$ in a \emph{vacuum} region of an
asymptotically flat stationary spacetime ruled by the Einstein equation
with $\Lambda=0$ share the same Komar mass:
\be
    M_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} = M_{\Sp_{\rm int}} .
\ee
\end{prop}
We then have:
\begin{prop}[Komar mass at infinity]
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a stationary and asympotically flat $n$-dimensional spacetime.
Let $\Sigma$ be any spacelike hypersurface that is asymptotically orthogonal
to the stationary Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$.
If the energy-momentum tensor $\w{T}$ has a compact support
$\mathscr{D}\subset \M$, the Komar mass over a closed $(n-2)$-surface $\Sp$ lying in
$\Sigma$ is independent of $\Sp$ as long as $\Sp$ lies outside
$\mathscr{D}$. Moreover, it is independent of the choice of $\Sigma$ as well.
We shall call it the \defin{Komar mass at infinity} of the spacetime
$(\M,\w{g})$ and denote it by $M_\infty$.
\end{prop}

\subsection{N+1 decomposition} \label{s:sta:np1_decomp}

Let $\mathcal{N} := n - 1$, $n$ being the spacetime dimension.
Given a spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma$, with future-directed unit normal
$\w{n}$,
the \defin{$\bm{\mathcal{N}}$+1 decomposition}\index{$\mathcal{N}+1$ decomposition}
of $\w{\xi}$ with respect to $\Sigma$
is the pair $(N, \w{\beta})$ where $N$ is a scalar field on $\Sigma$
and $\w{\beta}$ is a vector field tangent to $\Sigma$ such that
\be \label{e:sta:xi_3p1}
    \w{\xi} = N \w{n} + \w{\beta} .
\ee
In other words, $\w{\beta}$ is the orthogonal projection of $\w{\xi}$ on $\Sigma$
and $N \w{n}$ is the part of $\w{\xi}$ along $\w{n}$.
$N$ and $\w{\beta}$ are uniquely determined by
$N = - \w{n}\cdot\w{\xi}$ and
$\w{\beta} = \w{\xi} + (\w{n}\cdot\w{\xi}) \w{n}$.
In the language of the $\mathcal{N}$+1 formalism of general
relativity, $N$ is called the \defin{lapse function}\index{lapse function}
and $\w{\beta}$ the \defin{shift vector}\index{shift vector} (cf. e.g. Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}).

Similarly, the \defin{$\bm{\mathcal{N}}$+1 decomposition} of the energy-momentum tensor $\w{T}$ with respect
to the hypersurface $\Sigma$ is the
triplet $(E, \w{p}, \w{S})$, where $E$ is a scalar field,
$\w{p}$ is a 1-form satisfying $\langle \w{p}, \w{n} \rangle = 0$
and $\w{S}$ is a symmetric type-$(0,2)$ tensor field satisfying
$\w{S}(\w{n}, .) = 0$, such that\footnote{See e.g. Sec.~5.1.2 of Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}.}
\be \label{e:sta:T_3p1}
    \w{T} = E \uu{n}\otimes \uu{n} + \uu{n} \otimes \w{p}
    + \w{p}\otimes \uu{n} + \w{S} .
\ee
$E$, $\w{p}$ and $\w{S}$ are uniquely determined by
\be \label{e:sta:E_p_S_3p1}
    E = T_{\mu\nu} n^\mu n^\nu, \quad
    p_\alpha = - n^\mu T_{\mu \nu} \gamma^\nu_{\ \, \alpha},  \quad
    S_{\alpha\beta} = T_{\mu \nu} \gamma^\mu_{\ \, \alpha} \gamma^\nu_{\ \, \beta} ,
\ee
where $\gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \beta} =  \delta^\alpha_{\ \, \beta} + n^\alpha n_\beta$
stands for the \defin{orthogonal projector onto}\index{orthogonal!projector}
$\Sigma$.
Physically, $E$
is the matter energy density measured by the observer $\Obs$ of 4-velocity $\w{n}$,
$\w{p}$ is the matter momentum
density measured by $\Obs$ and $\w{S}$ is the matter stress tensor measured by $\Obs$.

\begin{prop}[$\bm{\mathcal{N}}$+1 expression of the Komar mass]
Under the same hypotheses as Property~\ref{p:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ},
one can rewrite Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ}) as
\be \label{e:sta:Komar_mass_3p1}
    \encadre{ M_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} = M_{\Sp_{\rm int}} +
    2 \int_{\Sigma} \left[ \frac{N}{n-2} \left[ (n-3) E + S \right] - \langle \w{p}, \w{\beta} \rangle  \right]
    \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-1}  , }
\ee
where $S := g^{\mu\nu} S_{\mu\nu} = \gamma^{ij} S_{ij}$
is the trace of the stress tensor $\w{S}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
From Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:T_3p1}), the trace of the energy-momentum tensor
is $T := g^{\mu\nu} T_{\mu\nu} = E n_\mu n^\mu + n_\mu p^\mu + p_\mu n^\mu + S = - E + S$,
since $n_\mu n^\mu = - 1$ and $p_\mu n^\mu = 0$.
In view of Eqs.~(\ref{e:sta:xi_3p1}) and (\ref{e:sta:T_3p1}), we can then rewrite
the integrand in the r.h.s. of Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ}) as
\[
 \w{T}(\w{n}, \w{\xi}) - \frac{T}{n-2} \w{n}\cdot \w{\xi} =
 N \underbrace{\w{T}(\w{n}, \w{n})}_{E}
 + \underbrace{\w{T}(\w{n}, \w{\beta})}_{-\langle \w{p}, \w{\beta} \rangle}
 - \frac{S - E}{n-2} \underbrace{\w{n}\cdot \w{\xi}}_{-N}
 =  \frac{N}{n-2} \left[ (n-3) E + S \right] - \langle \w{p}, \w{\beta} \rangle .
\]
This establishes Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_3p1}).
\end{proof}



\subsection{Link between the Komar mass and the ADM mass}  \label{s:sta:Komar_ADM}

For generic (i.e. not necessarily stationary) asymptotically flat spacetimes,
there exists the concept of \emph{ADM energy-momentum}\index{ADM!energy-momentum}, \emph{ADM} standing for
Arnowitt, Deser and Misner \cite{ArnowDM62}. It arises from the Hamiltonian
formulation of general relativity developed by these authors.
For a spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma$ that is asymptotically Euclidean,
the \defin{ADM energy}\index{ADM!energy} of $\Sigma$ is defined
as some flux over a closed $(n-2)$-sphere $\Sp$ of quantities involving derivatives
of the metric $\w{\gamma}$ induced by $\w{g}$ on $\Sigma$, in the limit where
the coordinate radius of $\Sp$ tends to infinity, while the
3 components of the \defin{ADM momentum}\index{ADM!momentum}
of $\Sigma$ are defined by similar integrals with quantities involving the extrinsic curvature
tensor $\w{K}$ of $\Sigma$ (see e.g. \cite{JaramG11},
Chap.~8 of \cite{Gourg12}, Sec.~4.3 of \cite{Poiss04},
Sec.~3.7 of \cite{Strau13} or Sec.~3.2.1 of \cite{Szaba09} for details).
The \defin{ADM mass}\index{ADM!mass} of $\Sigma$
is then defined as the Minkowskian norm of the ADM energy-momentum.
For a vanishing ADM momentum, the ADM mass coincides with the ADM energy.
One may then ask the relation with the Komar mass if the spacetimes is stationary.
The answer is very simple:
\begin{prop}[Equality of Komar and ADM masses \textnormal{(Beig 1978)}]
If $(\M,\w{g})$ is a stationary and asymptotically flat $n$-dimensional spacetime,
its Komar mass at infinity equals the ADM mass of any spacelike hypersurface
$\Sigma$ that is asymptotically orthogonal to the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$.
\end{prop}
For $n=4$, the proof can be found in R.~Beig's\index{Beig, R.} article \cite{Beig78}
(see also Ref.~\cite{AshteM79} for a different proof), while the proof
for $n>4$ has been obtained by H.~Barzegar, P.T.~Chruściel and M.~Hörzinger \cite{BarzgCH17}.

\subsection{Komar angular momentum} \label{s:sta:Komar_angu_mom}

As a stationary Killing vector gave birth to the Komar mass,
an axisymmetric Killing vector gives birth to an invariant integral quantity:
the Komar angular momentum. Before discussing it, let us first introduce
the concept of axisymmetry.

An asymptotically flat spacetime $(\M, \w{g})$ is \defin{axisymmetric} iff it is invariant
under the action of the rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ (or equivalently $\mathrm{U}(1)$)
and the orbits of the group action\footnote{Cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:symmetries} for the definitions of \emph{group action} and \emph{orbit}.} are spacelike curves at least near infinity.
Since $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is a one-parameter Lie group, its action is generated by a single Killing vector $\w{\eta}$,
which is unique up to some scaling constant.
The orbits of the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ action being closed curves, we shall fix the scaling constant
so that the group parameter $\ph$ associated with $\w{\eta}$ has the standard periodicity $2\pi$.
If non-empty, the set of points of $\M$ left invariant by the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ action is called the
\defin{rotation axis}\index{rotation!axis}. Equivalently, the rotation axis is the set of points
where the Killing vector $\w{\eta}$ vanishes. Usually, if the dimension of $\M$ is $n$, the rotation
axis is a submanifold of $\M$ of dimension $n-2$. Moreover, it is a timelike submanifold in the region
where the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ orbits are spacelike.


Let $(\M, \w{g})$ be an axisymmetric $n$-dimensional spacetime,
with axisymmetric Killing vector $\w{\eta}$.
Given a spacelike closed $(n-2)$-surface $\Sp\subset\M$,
the \defin{Komar angular momentum over}\index{Komar!angular momentum}\index{angular!momentum!Komar --} $\Sp$ is
defined by
\be \label{e:sta:def_Komar_J}
    \encadre{ J_{\Sp} := \frac{1}{16\pi} \int_{\Sp} \star(\dd \uu{\eta}) } ,
\ee
where $\star(\dd \uu{\eta})$
is the Hodge dual of the 2-form $\dd \uu{\eta}$ given by
\be
    (\dd \uu{\eta})_{\alpha\beta} =
        \partial_\alpha \eta_\beta - \partial_\beta \eta_\alpha =
        \nabla_\alpha \eta_\beta - \nabla_\beta \eta_\alpha .
\ee

\begin{remark}
Besides the change $\w{\xi}\leftrightarrow\w{\eta}$, we notice a difference by a factor $-(n-2)/(n-3)$ between the r.h.s. of (\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_mass}) and (\ref{e:sta:def_Komar_J}). For $n=4$, this factor is $-2$ and is
known as \emph{Komar's anomalous factor} (see Ref.~\cite{Katz85} for a discussion).
\end{remark}

Formulas (\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_flux_nabla_xi}) and (\ref{e:sta:M_Komar_partial_der})
for the Komar mass rely only on the fact that $\w{\xi}$ is a Killing vector.
In an axisymmetric spacetime, we may therefore replace $\w{\xi}$ by $\w{\eta}$
and the numerical prefactor by $1/(16\pi)$ to get the following expressions
for the Komar angular momentum:
\be
    \encadre{ J_{\Sp} = \frac{1}{16\pi} \int_{\Sp} \nabla_\mu \eta_\nu \,  \D S^{\mu\nu} }
\ee
and
\be \label{e:sta:J_Komar_partial_der}
    \encadre{ J_{\Sp} = \frac{1}{16\pi} \int_{\Sp} \partial_\mu \eta_\nu (s^\mu   n^\nu - n^\mu s^\nu)
    \sqrt{q}\, \D x^1 \cdots  \D x^{n-2} } .
\ee
Similarly, the volume integral formula (\ref{e:sta:Komar_mass_vol_integ}) for the
Komar mass relies only the Einstein equation and $\w{\xi}$ being a Killing vector.
We may therefore transpose it to the Komar angular momentum:

\begin{prop}[Volume integral formula for the Komar angular momentum]
Let $(\M, \w{g})$ be an axisymmetric $n$-dimensional spacetime,
with axisymmetric Killing vector $\w{\eta}$. Let us assume that $\w{g}$
obeys the Einstein equation (\ref{e:fra:Einstein_eq}) with some energy-momentum
tensor $\w{T}$ and a vanishing cosmological constant.
Let $\Sigma$ be a compact spacelike hypersurface bounded by two closed $(n-2)$-surfaces:
an ``internal'' one, $\Sp_{\rm int}$, and an ``external'' one,
$\Sp_{\rm ext}$, the exterior direction being that of the asymptotic flat end of $(\M, \w{g})$.
The Komar angular momenta over $\Sp_{\rm ext}$ and $\Sp_{\rm int}$ are then
related by
\be \label{e:sta:Komar_angul_vol_integ}
    \encadre{ J_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} = J_{\Sp_{\rm int}} -
    \int_{\Sigma} \left( \w{T}(\w{n}, \w{\eta}) - \frac{T}{n-2} \, \w{n}\cdot\w{\eta} \right)
    \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-1}  , }
\ee
where $\w{n}$ is the future-directed unit normal to $\Sigma$,
$\sqrt{\gamma}\,\D x^1 \cdots \D x^{n-1}$ is the volume element on $\Sigma$
induced by $\w{g}$ and $T:= \mathrm{tr}_{\w{g}} \w{T} = g^{\mu\nu} T_{\mu\nu}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
Since the axisymmetry generator $\w{\eta}$ is spacelike, the spacelike hypersurface
$\Sigma$ can be chosen so that $\w{\eta}$ is tangent to it; one has then
$\w{n}\cdot\w{\eta} = 0$ and the second term in the integrand of
Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_angul_vol_integ}) vanishes identically.
Moreover, if one expresses $\w{T}$ via the $\mathcal{N}$+1 decomposition (\ref{e:sta:T_3p1}),
one can write the first term as $\w{T}(\w{n}, \w{\eta}) = - \langle \w{p}, \w{\eta} \rangle$,
so that formula (\ref{e:sta:Komar_angul_vol_integ}) simplifies to
\be
    J_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} = J_{\Sp_{\rm int}} +
    \int_{\Sigma} \langle \w{p}, \w{\eta} \rangle \,
    \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D x^1 \D x^2 \D x^3 .
\ee
\end{remark}

As for the Komar mass (Property~\ref{p:sta:Komar_mass_invariant}), it follows
immediately from Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:Komar_angul_vol_integ}) that

\begin{prop}[Independence of the Komar angular momentum from the integration surface]
Two $(n-2)$-surfaces $\Sp_{\rm ext}$ and $\Sp_{\rm int}$ that are connected by
a spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma$ in a \emph{vacuum} region of an
axisymmetric spacetime ruled by the Einstein equation share the same Komar
angular momentum:
\be
    J_{\Sp_{\rm ext}} = J_{\Sp_{\rm int}} .
\ee
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
There is no concept of ``ADM angular momentum'' (due to the so-called
\emph{supertranslation ambiguity} at spatial infinity, cf. e.g. Sec.~8.5
of Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}), so there is no point in comparing the Komar angular momentum
with it, contrary to what was done in Sec.~\ref{s:sta:Komar_ADM} for the mass.
\end{remark}

\section{The event horizon as a Killing horizon} \label{s:sta:EH_KH}

In view of Property~\ref{p:sta:xi_tangent_H}, let us
examine successively the two allowed types for the
Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ on the event horizon $\Hor$ of a stationary black hole:
$\w{\xi}$ null (Sec.~\ref{s:sta:staticity_thm})
and $\w{\xi}$ spacelike (Sec.~\ref{s:sta:strong_rigidity}). In both cases, we shall see
that $\Hor$ must be a Killing horizon; this is immediate
for $\w{\xi}$ null but not trivial for $\w{\xi}$ spacelike.

\subsection{Null stationary Killing field on $\Hor$: the staticity theorem}\label{s:sta:staticity_thm}

By Lemma~\ref{p:def:tangent_to_null_hyp} (Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}),
if the Killing vector
field $\w{\xi}$ is null on $\Hor$, it is necessarily tangent to the null geodesic generators
of $\Hor$ and therefore collinear to the null normals $\wl$ of $\Hor$. From the definition
of a Killing horizon
given in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:def_Killing_hor}, we get immediately:

\begin{prop}[event horizon as a Killing horizon for $\w{\xi}$ null on it]
\label{p:sta:H_Killing_hor_xi_null}
In a stationary spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ containing a black hole
of event horizon $\Hor$, if the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$
is null on $\Hor$, then $\Hor$ is a Killing horizon with respect to $\w{\xi}$.
\end{prop}

It follows that, on $\Hor$, the Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$
is hypersurface-orthogonal, being normal to $\Hor$. Under certain hypotheses, especially
that the vacuum Einstein equation is fulfilled, one can go further
and prove that $\w{\xi}$ must actually be hypersurface-orthogonal everywhere in $\M$,
i.e. that $(\M,\w{g})$ is \emph{static} (cf. the definition given in Sec.~\ref{s:sta:def_station}):

\begin{prop}[staticity theorem\index{staticity theorem} \textnormal{(Sudarsky\index{Sudarsky, D.} \& Wald\index{Wald, R.M.}  1993 \cite{SudarW93})}]
\label{p:sta:staticity_thm}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be an asymptotically flat stationary spacetime of dimension $n\geq 4$
that contains a black hole of event horizon $\Hor$ so that
the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ is null on $\Hor$. By Property~\ref{p:sta:H_Killing_hor_xi_null}, $\Hor$ is a Killing horizon. If $\Hor$ is
non-degenerate (i.e. has a non-vanishing surface gravity $\kappa$, cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:classif_KH})
and $\w{g}$ obeys the vacuum Einstein equation, then the spacetime
is static\index{static!spacetime} and the domain of outer communications\index{domain of outer communications} (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:def_BH}) is strictly static.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Since $\Hor$ is a non-degenerate Killing horizon, it is contained in a bifurcate Killing horizon
(cf. Property~\ref{p:sta:non_degen_bifurcate} and Remark~\ref{r:sta:extension_bifurcate} on p.~\pageref{r:sta:extension_bifurcate}).
Let $\Sp$ be the corresponding bifurcation surface.
Thanks to a theorem by Chru\'sciel\index{Chrusciel, P.T.@Chru\'sciel, P.T.} \&
Wald\index{Wald, R.M.} (Theorem~4.2 in Ref.~\cite{ChrusW94a}),
the domain domain of outer communications can be foliated by a family of
spacelike hypersurfaces $(\Sigma_t)_{t\in\R}$
that are asymptotically flat, are asymptotically orthogonal to $\w{\xi}$,
have $\Sp$ as inner boundary, are Lie-dragged\footnote{$\Sigma_{t+\D t}$ is the image of $\Sigma_t$ by the infinitesimal displacement $\D t\, \w{\xi}$.}
to each other by $\w{\xi}$ and are \defin{maximal}\index{maximal!hypersurface}.
The last property means that the
extrinsic curvature\index{extrinsic curvature}\index{curvature!extrinsic --}
tensor $\w{K}$ of each hypersurface $\Sigma_t$
has a vanishing trace: $K^i_{\ \, i} = 0$, or equivalently, that
the unit normal $\w{n}$ to $\Sigma_t$ is divergence-free : $\nabla_\mu n^\mu = 0$
(cf. Sec.~10.2.2 of Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}).
Let us consider the $\mathcal{N}+1$ decomposition with respect to $\Sigma_t$
introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:sta:np1_decomp}.
The maximality property $K^i_{\ \, i} = 0$ allows one
to simplify one of the Einstein equations in the $\mathcal{N}+1$ decomposition,
namely the momemtum constraint\index{momentum constraint} (see e.g. Chap.~5 of Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}),
which reduces to $D^j K_{ij} = 8\pi p_i$, where $\w{D}$ is the Levi-Civita connection
associated to the metric $\w{\gamma}$ induced by $\w{g}$ on $\Sigma_t$ and $\w{p}$ is the matter energy-momentum density in the hypersurface $\Sigma_t$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:sta:np1_decomp}).
Since we consider the vacuum case, we have $\w{p} = 0$. Hence the momentum
constraint reduces to $D^j K_{ij} = 0$. Contracting with $\w{\beta}$, we get
\[
    0 = D^j K_{ij} \beta^i
    =  D^j \left( K_{ij} \beta^i \right) - K_{ij} D^j \beta^i
     =  D^j \left( K_{ij} \beta^i \right) - N K_{ij} K^{ij}   ,
\]
where the last equality results from the symmetry of $K_{ij}$ and the identity
$D^j \beta^i + D^i \beta^j = 2N K^{ij}$, which holds for the shift vector $\w{\beta}$
associated with the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ (see e.g. Eqs.~(5.66) and
(5.67) in Ref.~\cite{Gourg12} with $\dert{\gamma_{ij}}{t} = 0$).
Let us integrate the above equation over $\Sigma_t$ and
use the Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem for the divergence term
$D^j \left( K_{ij} \beta^i \right)$, taking into account that
the boundary of $\Sigma_t$ is made
of the bifurcation sphere $\Sp$ (inner boundary) and the sphere ``at infinity''
$\Sp_\infty$ (outer boundary), the latter being a $(n-2)$-sphere in $\Sigma_t$
of coordinate radius $r\to +\infty$ ($r$ is defined from the asymptotic flatness
property). We get
\[
    \int_{\Sp_\infty} s^j K_{ij} \beta^i \sqrt{q} \,  \D^{n-2} x
    - \int_{\Sp} s^j K_{ij} \beta^i \sqrt{q} \, \D^{n-2} x
    -  \int_{\Sigma_t} N K_{ij} K^{ij}  \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D^{n-1} x =  0 ,
\]
where $\w{s}$ is the unit normal to $\Sp_\infty$ and $\Sp$ in $\Sigma_t$,
oriented towards the asymptotic flat end of $\Sigma_t$. Now, each of the two surface
integrals vanishes identically:
the first one because on the asymptotically flat slice $\Sigma_t$, $\w{K}$ decays
as $O(r^{-2})$ for $r\to +\infty$ and, still in this limit,  $\w{\beta}\to 0$
since $\w{\xi}$ is asymptotically orthogonal to $\Sigma_t$
[cf. the orthogonal decomposition~(\ref{e:sta:xi_3p1})].
As for the integral over $\Sp$, it is zero because
$\left. \w{\beta} \right| _{\Sp} =  0$.
Indeed, since $\Sp$ is the bifurcation surface of a bifurcate Killing
horizon with respect to $\w{\xi}$ (Property~\ref{p:sta:H_Killing_hor_xi_null}),
one has  $\left. \w{\xi} \right| _{\Sp} = 0$ (Property~\ref{p:sta:xi_S_zero}),
which implies via Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:xi_3p1}) both $\left. N \right| _{\Sp} = 0$ and
$\left. \w{\beta} \right| _{\Sp} = 0$. We therefore get
\[
    \int_{\Sigma_t} N K_{ij} K^{ij} \, \sqrt{\gamma} \, \D^{n-1} x = 0 .
\]
Given that $N > 0$ on $\Sigma_t\setminus \Sp$ and $K_{ij} K^{ij} \geq 0$ on $\Sigma_t$ (for
$K_{ij} K^{ij} = \gamma^{ik} \gamma^{jl} K_{ij} K_{kl}$ with
$\w{\gamma}$ being a Riemannian metric), the vanishing of the above integral
implies $K_{ij} = 0$.
Now, $\w{K} = - (2N)^{-1} \Lie{\w{m}} \w{\gamma}$ (cf. Eq.~(4.30) in Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}), where $\w{m} := N \w{n}$
is the evolution vector along the normal to $\Sigma_t$ (cf. Sec.~4.3 of Ref.~\cite{Gourg12}).
The vanishing of $\w{K}$ implies then
\be \label{e:sta:dot_gamma_dot_pi}
   \dot{\w{\gamma}} :=  \Lie{\w{m}} \w{\gamma} = 0 \qand
   \dot{\w{\pi}} :=  \Lie{\w{m}} \w{\pi} = 0 ,
\ee
where $\w{\pi}$ is the momentum canonically conjugate to $\w{\gamma}$ in
the ADM Hamiltonian formulation\index{Hamiltonian!formulation of general relativity}\index{ADM!Hamiltonian formulation} of general relativity \cite{ArnowDM62,FischM79}.
$\w{\pi}$ is a tensor density
that is related to the extrinsic curvature tensor $\w{K}$ by
$\pi^{ij} = \sqrt{\gamma} (K^k_{\ \, k} \gamma^{ij} - K^{ij})$.
Hence, $\w{K} = 0$ implies $\w{\pi} = 0$ so that $\dot{\w{\pi}} = 0$ in
Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:dot_gamma_dot_pi}) is trivially fulfilled. In the Hamiltonian formulation,
the spacetime dynamics is entirely described by the ``time development'' (i.e. the variation
accross the $\Sigma_t$ foliation) of
$(\w{\gamma}, \w{\pi})$, which are the $(q,p)$ pairs of Hamiltonian mechanics. Hamilton's equations (\ref{e:sta:dot_gamma_dot_pi}) shows that $(\w{\gamma}, \w{\pi})$ do not evolve at all.
This means that $\w{m}$ is a Killing vector of the spacetime metric
$\w{g}$. Since $\w{m} = N \w{n}$ is by construction timelike and hypersurface-orthogonal,
this proves that the part of spacetime foliated by the $(\Sigma_t)_{t\in\R}$,
i.e. the domain of outer communications, is strictly static. The connection
between $\w{m}$ and $\w{\xi}$ is given by
Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:xi_3p1}): $\w{\xi} = \w{m} + \w{\beta}$. Hence the Killing vectors
$\w{\xi}$ and $\w{m}$ coincide iff the shift vector $\w{\beta}$ vanishes.
If $\w{\beta}$ would not vanish identically, it would be a Killing vector itself,
as the difference $\w{\xi} - \w{m}$ of two Killing vectors.
However, as seen above,
$\w{\beta}$ vanishes at the inner boundary $\Sp$ of $\Sigma_t$
and at the ``outer boundary'', i.e. for $r\to +\infty$.
In most cases, these constraints will result in $\w{\beta} = 0$ (for instance, they
exclude $\w{\beta}$ being a rotational Killing vector), so that we conclude
that $\w{m} = \w{\xi}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
In the original formulation by Sudarsky \& Wald (Theorem~2 of Ref.~\cite{SudarW93}), the non-degeneracy of $\Hor$
is replaced by $\Hor$ being part of a bifurcate Killing horizon.
However, as mentioned in the above proof, these two properties are essentially equivalent.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
The theorem proved by Sudarsky \& Wald (Theorem~2 in Ref.~\cite{SudarW93})
is actually more general: it regards solutions of the
\emph{electrovacuum}\index{electrovacuum} Einstein equation,
i.e. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:Einstein_eq}) with either $\w{T} = 0$ (the case considered here)
or $\w{T}$ being the energy-momentum tensor of a source-free electromagnetic
field $\w{F}$ that is stationary: $\Lie{\w{\xi}} \w{F} = 0$ (one says that
$(\w{g},\w{F})$ is a solution of the stationary Einstein-Maxwell system\index{Einstein-Maxwell system}).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Sudarsky \& Wald stated the staticity theorem for the dimension $n=4$ but, as pointed out in
Refs.~\cite{Chrus05,ChrusLH12,HollaI12}, the theorem straightforwardly generalizes
to $n \geq 4$. Actually, the proof given above\footnote{The first part of the proof,
leading to $\w{K} = 0$, differs from Sudarsky \& Wald's one, which is based on integral
mass formulas.}
does not assume $n=4$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
For the dimension $n=4$, it turns out that the hypothesis of non-degeneracy of $\Hor$
is not necessary: as the uniqueness theorem ?? below shows,
the spacetime is static even if the event horizon is degenerate.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Spacelike stationary Killing field on $\Hor$: the strong rigidity theorem}
\label{s:sta:strong_rigidity}

When the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ is spacelike
on some part of the event horizon $\Hor$, it obviously cannot be collinear to
a null normal $\wl$ of $\Hor$.
Assuming that $\Hor$ has cross-sections of spherical topology, we observe
that, with respect to the null geodesic generators of $\Hor$, the field lines of $\w{\xi}$
form some helices, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:sta:rot_horizon}a. By reciprocity,
with respect to the field lines of $\w{\xi}$,
the null geodesic generators form some helices as well, as depicted in
Fig.~\ref{f:sta:rot_horizon}b):
observe that Fig.~\ref{f:sta:rot_horizon}b can be obtained from Fig.~\ref{f:sta:rot_horizon}a
by ``untwisting'' the field lines of $\w{\xi}$.
Since asymptotically the field lines of $\w{\xi}$ are worldlines of inertial observers,
Fig.~\ref{f:sta:rot_horizon}b leads us to say
(in loose terms at this stage, this will be made more precise by Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:chi_xi_OmegaH_eta}) below) that the event horizon $\Hor$
``is rotating'', all the more that we have seen above that when the null
generators coincide with the field lines of $\w{\xi}$, the black hole is static, i.e. non-rotating.

\begin{figure}

while the null normal $\wl$ is always tangent to them. }
\end{figure}

Since the Killing field $\w{\xi}$ is not null on $\Hor$, we cannot say a priori
that $\Hor$ is a Killing horizon. However, modulo some additional hypotheses,
it turns out that this is the case, according to a famous result by
S.W.~Hawking\index{Hawking, S.W.} (1972)
\cite{Hawki72,HawkiE73}, known as the
\defin{strong rigidity theorem}\index{strong!rigidity theorem}\index{rigidity theorem!strong --}.
We give below a modern version of this theorem, due to
Hollands, Ishibashi \& Wald (2007) \cite{HollaIW07}
and Moncrief \& Isenberg (2008) \cite{MoncrI08} (see also
Theorem~8.1 p.~470 of Choquet-Bruhat's textbook \cite{Choqu09}).
\begin{prop}[strong rigidity theorem]
\label{p:sta:strong_rigidity_thm}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a stationary spacetime of dimension $n\geq 4$ containing a black
hole of event horizon $\Hor$ such that the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$
is spacelike on some parts of $\Hor$. If
\begin{itemize}
\item $\M$ and $\Hor$ are (real) analytic manifold
(cf. Remark~\ref{r:bas:analytic} in Sec.~\ref{s:bas:def_manif}),
with $\w{g}$ being an analytic field,
\item $\w{g}$ fulfills the vacuum Einstein equation
[Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:Einstein_eq}) with $\Lambda=0$ and $\w{T} = 0$],
\item $n=4$ or $\Hor$ has a null geodesic generator that is incomplete,
\item $\Hor$ has compact and connected cross-sections,
\item $\w{\xi}$ is transverse to some cross-sections,
\end{itemize}
then the spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ admits a second Killing vector, $\w{\chi}$
say, such that $\w{\xi}$ and $\w{\chi}$ commute: $[\w{\xi}, \w{\chi}] = 0$ and
$\Hor$ is a Killing horizon with respect to $\w{\chi}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
The proof of the strong rigidity theorem is pretty long and we
give here only a sketch for $n=4$, refering to Ref.~\cite{HawkiE73} (Proposition~9.3.6)
for full details and Refs.~\cite{HollaIW07,HollaI12,MoncrI08}
for $n>4$.
Let us thus assume $n=4$ and that the vacuum Einstein equation holds.
The null dominant energy condition is then satisfied and, since
$\Hor$ is connected, the topology theorem 1 (Property~\ref{p:sta:topology1})
implies that the cross-sections of $\Hor$ have the topology of $\SS^2$,
or equivalently that the topology of $\Hor$ is $\R\times\SS^2$. One can define an abstract 2-dimensional manifold $\hat{\Sp}$
by taking the quotient of $\Hor$ along its null generators, i.e. by identifying
two points on $\Hor$ if they belong to the same null geodesic generator $\Li$. Given the
topology of $\Hor$'s cross-sections, $\hat{\Sp}$ is clearly a 2-dimensional
manifold of topology $\SS^2$. In view of the definition
of a cross-section (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}),
one can identify $\hat{\Sp}$
with a given cross-section $\Sp_0$ of $\Hor$ if necessary.
Taking avantage that $\Hor$ is a non-expanding horizon (Property~\ref{p:sta:hor_non_exanding}),
one can endow $\hat{\Sp}$ with a unique Riemannian metric $\hat{\w{q}}$
thanks to Property~\ref{p:neh:invariance_of_2metric}. If one sticks to the $\Sp_0$ model
of $\hat{\Sp}$, this metric is nothing but the metric $\w{q}$ induced by
the spacetime metric $\w{g}$ on $\Sp_0$. Now the spacetime stationary action
$\M \to \M$, $p \mapsto \Phi_t(p)$
induces an isometry group of $(\hat{\Sp},\hat{\w{q}})$ as follows.
Let $\Li$ be a null geodesic generator of $\Hor$; for
$t\in\R$, $\Phi_t(\Li)$ is a null geodesic of $(\M,\w{g})$ since $\Phi_t$ is
an isometry. Furthermore, given that $\Hor$ is globally invariant by $\Phi_t$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:sta:BH_stationary}), $\Phi_t(\Li) \subset \Hor$. Hence
$\Phi_t(\Li)$ is a generator of $\Hor$ and we conclude that
$\Phi_t$ maps generators of $\Hor$ to generators of $\Hor$. It therefore
induces a map $\hat{\Phi}_t: \hat{\Sp} \to \hat{\Sp}$. Furthermore, this map
is an isometry of the metric $\hat{\w{q}}$, given that $\Phi_t$ is an isometry
on $\Hor$. Given the $\R\times \SS^2$ topology of $\Hor$, for each $p\in\Hor$,
there is a smallest $T>0$ such that $\Phi_T(p)$ lies on the same null generator
as $p$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:sta:rot_horizon}). It follows that
$\hat{\Phi}_{t + T} = \hat{\Phi}_t$. In other words, the 1-dimensional group action
defined by $\hat{\Phi}_t$ on $\hat{\Sp}$ has closed orbits, of period $T$.
It follows that the underlying group is the rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$
and we conclude that $(\hat{\Sp},\hat{\w{q}})$ is an axisymmetric Riemannian manifold
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:sta:Komar_angu_mom}). This axisymmetry transfers immediately
to the fiducial cross-section $\Sp_0$ and we conclude that, in addition to be
stationary, the event horizon $\Hor$ is axisymmetric.

The axisymmetry can be extended to the whole spacetime as follows.
Let $\w{\chi}=\D\w{x}/\D v$ be a vector tangent to the null generators of $\Hor$
corresponding to a parameter $v$ of the generators that is connected to the parameter
$t$ of the stationary action, in the sense that along a given null generator
$\Li$,
\be
\label{e:sta:vPhiT_v_p_T}
    v(\Phi_T(p)) = v(p) + T.
\ee
The vector $\w{\chi}$ is invariant
under the stationary action, i.e. $\Lie{\w{\xi}} \w{\chi} = 0$, so that
$\w{\xi}$ and $\w{\chi}$ commute: $[\w{\xi}, \w{\chi}] = 0$.
Let then define the following vector field on $\Hor$:
\be \label{e:sta:def_eta_rigidity}
    \w{\eta} := \frac{1}{\Omega_H} \left( \w{\chi} - \w{\xi} \right) ,
    \qquad \mbox{with}\quad \Omega_H := \frac{2\pi}{T} .
\ee
$\w{\eta}$ has by constrution closed field lines, of period $2\pi$.
Indeed, since $\w{\xi}$ and $\w{\chi}$ commute, moving by a parameter $2\pi$
along $\w{\eta}$ is equivalent to moving by a parameter $t=-T$ along the field
lines of $\w{\xi}$ and then by a parameter $v=T$ along the field lines of
$\w{\chi}$; the property (\ref{e:sta:vPhiT_v_p_T}) ensures that one is back
to the starting point.
Given the $\SS^2$
topology of $\hat{\Sp}$, there are two fixed points $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$ of the axisymmetric
action of $\hat{\Sp}$
defining the ``axis'' of the rotations. Let $\Li_1$ and $\Li_2$ the corresponding
null generators of $\Hor$. Let $\mathscr{C}$ be a curve in $\Hor$
from $\Li_1$ and $\Li_2$, orthogonal to $\w{\eta}$ and
such that the field lines of $\w{\eta}$ from $\mathscr{C}$ form
a smooth cross-section $\Sp$ of $\Hor$. Let us then denote by $\Sp_v$ the
cross-section obtained by displacing $\Sp$ by a parameter $v$ along $\w{\chi}$.
Finally, let $\w{k}$ be the future-directed null vector orthogonal to $\Sp_v$ and complementary
to $\w{\chi}$, normalized such that $\w{\chi}\cdot\w{k} = -1$ ($\w{k}$ is
transverse to $\Hor$ and is pointing towards the black hole region).
In a neighbourhood of $\Hor$, we introduce a spacetime coordinate system $(v,r,\th,\ph)$,
named \defin{Gaussian null coordinates}\index{Gaussian!null coordinates}, as follows.
First of all, we choose spherical coordinates $(\th,\ph)$ on the cross-section
$\Sp$, such that $\w{\eta} = \wpar_\ph$ and $\th$ is a parameter along the
the ``meridional'' curve $\mathscr{C}$. To any point $p\in\Hor$, we assign
then the coordinates $(v,\th,\ph)$ where $v$ is such that $p\in \Sp_v$
and $(\th,\ph)$ are the coordinates
of the intersection of $\Sp$ and the null generator $\Li$ through $p$.
Let us then consider the null geodesics $\Li'$
of tangent vector $\w{k}$, which are transverse to $\Hor$ and an affine parameter
$r$ along each of them such that, on $\Hor$, $r=0$ and $\w{k} = - \D{\w{x}}/\D r$.
To any point $p\in \Li'$ in the vicinity of $\Hor$, we assign the coordinates $(v,r,\th,\ph)$
such that $r$ is the affine parameter of $p$ along $\Li'$ and $(v,\th,\ph)$
are the coordinates of the intersection of $\Li'$ and $\Hor$. We may then extend
the vector fields $\w{\chi}$, $\w{\eta}$ and $\w{k}$ away from $\Hor$ by setting
\[
    \w{\chi} := \wpar_v,\quad
    \w{\eta} := \wpar_\ph,\quad
    \w{k} := - \wpar_r .
\]
By means of the vacuum Einstein equation, one can then show by induction that,
\be \label{e:sta:Lie_k_Lie_chi_g}
    \forall N\in\mathbb{N}, \quad \underbrace{\Lie{\w{k}}\cdots \Lie{\w{k}}}_{N\mbox{\ times}}
    \Lie{\w{\chi}} \w{g} \equalH 0 .
\ee
This is the lengthy part of the computation (see p.~343 Ref.~\cite{HawkiE73}).
Once (\ref{e:sta:Lie_k_Lie_chi_g})
is established, one can use the analyticity hypothesis to conclude that $\Lie{\w{\chi}} \w{g} = 0$
in all $\M$, i.e. that $\w{\chi}$ is a Killing vector of $(\M,\w{g})$. Since, on $\Hor$,
$\w{\chi}$ is normal to $\Hor$, it follows that $\Hor$ is a Killing horizon
with respect to $\w{\chi}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
For $n\neq 4$, the Killing horizon $\Hor$ is necessarily non-degenerate, given
that $\Hor$ must have an incomplete null geodesic generator in that case.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
For $n=4$, the stationary Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ cannot be spacelike
on the whole of $\Hor$: it is indeed null on the rotation axis, i.e.
at the points where $\w{\eta} = 0$, given that Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:def_eta_rigidity})
implies $\w{\xi} = \w{\chi}$ for $\w{\eta}=0$.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
In some formulations \cite{HollaIW07,HawkiE73}, the hypothesis of $\w{\xi}$
being transverse to some cross-sections is replaced by $\Hor$ lying in
the future of the past null infinity $\scri^-$. Actually it can be shown
that the latter implies the former (see e.g. the proof of Proposition~9.3.1
in Ref.~\cite{HawkiE73}).
\end{remark}



\begin{hist}
Stephen Hawking\index{Hawking, S.} first established the strong rigidity
theorem in 1972 \cite{Hawki72}
for a spacetime of dimension $n=4$ and assuming that there exists
a past event horizon (i.e. a white hole region) in addition to the
future event horizon $\Hor$.
The theorem was restated and proved without the white hole hypothesis
in Hawking \& Ellis'\index{Ellis, G.} famous textbook published in 1973 \cite{HawkiE73}
(Proposition 9.3.6). See Sec.~8 of Ref.~\cite{Hawki73} for an account by Hawking himself
about this reformulation.
Some details in Hawking's proof have been fixed
by Piotr T. Chru\'sciel\index{Chrusciel, P.T.@Chru\'sciel, P.T.} in 1997 \cite{Chrus97}.
The extension to spacetimes of
dimension $n\geq 4$ has been performed independently by
Stefan Hollands\index{Hollands, S.}, Akihiro Ishibashi\index{Ishibashi, A.}
and Robert M.~Wald\index{Wald, R.M.} in 2007 \cite{HollaIW07}
and by Vincent Moncrief\index{Moncrief, V.} and James Isenberg\index{Isenberg, J.}
in 2008 \cite{MoncrI08}.
\end{hist}

The strong rigidity theorem relies on the rather strong assumption that
the manifolds and fields are analytic.
On physical grounds,
it would be desirable to assume only \emph{smooth} manifolds and fields.
In 1999, H. Friedrich\index{Friedrich, H.}, I. Rácz\index{Racz, I.@R\'acz, I.},
and R.M. Wald\index{Wald, R.M.} \cite{FriedRW99} could remove the analyticity hypothesis but only
towards the \emph{interior} of the black hole, i.e. they could prove that
the vector $\w{\chi}$ normal to $\Hor$ can be extended to a Killing vector
of the black hole interior.
Another partial success has been acheived in 2014 by
S.~Alexakis\index{Alexakis, S.}, A.D.~Ionescu\index{Ionescu, A.D.} and
S.~Klainerman\index{Klainerman, S.} \cite{AlexaIK14}, who proved
the strong rigidity theorem without the analyticity
assumption, but only for slowly rotating black holes.
See Ref.~\cite{IonesK15} for a review of the progresses in removing
the analycity hypothesis.

A corollary of the strong rigidity theorem is

\begin{prop}[Axisymmetry of stationary black holes]
\label{p:sta:axisymmetry_BH}
Under the same hypotheses as in Property~\ref{p:sta:strong_rigidity_thm},
there exist $L$ Killing vectors $\w{\eta}_{(1)},\ldots,\w{\eta}_{(L)}$
with $1 \leq L \leq [(n-1)/2]$ with closed orbits with period $2\pi$
such that
\be
   [\w{\xi},\w{\eta}_{(i)}] = 0 \qand [\w{\eta}_{(i)},\w{\eta}_{(j)}] = 0
   \quad (1 \leq i, j \leq L)
\ee
and the horizon-generating Killing vector $\w{\chi}$ writes
\be \label{e:sta:chi_xi_Omega_i_eta_i}
    \w{\chi} = \w{\xi} + \Omega_{(1)} \w{\eta}_{(1)} + \cdots \Omega_{(L)} \w{\eta}_{(L)} ,
\ee
where $\Omega_{(1)}$, $\ldots$, $\Omega_{(L)}$ are $L$ constants, all of whose
ratios are irrational.

For $n=4$, one has necessarily $L=1$ and
denoting $\w{\eta}_{(1)}$ by simply $\w{\eta}$ and $\Omega_{(1)}$ by $\Omega_H$,
Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:chi_xi_Omega_i_eta_i}) reduces to
\be \label{e:sta:chi_xi_OmegaH_eta}
    \w{\chi} = \w{\xi} + \Omega_H \w{\eta} .
\ee
The constant $\Omega_H$ is then called \defin{black hole rotation velocity}\index{black hole!rotation velocity}\index{rotation!velocity}.
\end{prop}

Since it has closed orbits, the isometry group generated by each Killing vector
$\w{\eta}_{(i)}$ is $\mathrm{SO}(2)$. Each isometry is thus an axisymmetry,
according to the definition given in Sec.~\ref{s:sta:Komar_angu_mom}.
For $n=4$, Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:chi_xi_OmegaH_eta}) is
equivalent to Eq.~(\ref{e:sta:def_eta_rigidity}). For $n>4$, we refer
to the original articles \cite{HollaIW07,MoncrI08} for the demonstration.


\begin{remark}
Property~\ref{p:sta:axisymmetry_BH} is often considered as the second part
of the strong rigidity theorem. In some statements, it is even incorporated
into the strong rigidity theorem (e.g. Proposition~9.3.6 of Ref.~\cite{HawkiE73}).
\end{remark}


By the very definition of stationarity, the Killing vector field $\w{\xi}$ is
timelike in the vicinity of $\scri^+$ and $\scri^-$. If $\w{\xi}$ is spacelike
on some parts of $\Hor$, as assumed in this section, by continuity it must be spacelike
in some part of the domain of outer communications $\langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle$
near $\Hor$. The simplest configuration is when
$\w{\xi}$ is spacelike in some connected region $\mathscr{G}\subset \langle\langle \M\rangle\rangle$
around $\Hor$, null at the boundary of $\mathscr{G}$ and timelike outside $\mathscr{G}$
up to $\scri^+$ and $\scri^-$. The subset $\mathscr{G}$ is
called the \defin{ergoregion}\index{ergoregion} and its boundary $\E:=\partial\mathscr{G}$
the \defin{ergosphere}. We shall discuss it further in connection with
the Penrose process in Chap.~\ref{s:ker}.

\section{The no-hair theorem} \label{s:sta:no-hair}

\subsection{Israel uniqueness theorem for static black holes}

\begin{prop}[Israel uniqueness theorem\index{Israel uniqueness theorem}]
\label{p:sta:Israel_uniqueness_thm}
If $(\M,\w{g})$ is a $n$-dimensional static spacetime
containing a black hole, with $\w{g}$ solution of the vacuum Einstein
equation, then the domain of outer communications of $\M$ is isometric
to the domain of outer communications of a $n$-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime\index{Schwarzschild!spacetime}.
\end{prop}
This theorem has been proved in 1967 by W.~Israel \cite{Israe67},
and improved latter by many authors, in particular by
P. Chru\'sciel \& G. Galloway (2010) \cite{ChrusG10}, who removed
the hypothesis of analyticity (cf. Remark~\ref{r:bas:analytic} in Sec.~\ref{s:bas:def_manif}).
A demonstration of Israel's theorem can be found in Sec.~8.2 of
Straumann's textbook \cite{Strau13}.

So basically, in dimension $n=4$, i.e. when the staticity theorem (Property~\ref{p:sta:staticity_thm}) applies,
all stationary vacuum black holes with the stationary Killing field $\w{\xi}$ null
on $\Hor$ are nothing but Schwarzschild black holes, which we will study in detail in Chaps.~\ref{s:sch} to~\ref{s:max}.

\subsection{The no-hair theorem}

In dimension $n=4$, one can go much further then just claiming that the
event horizon of a stationary black hole must be a Killing horizon (Sec.~\ref{s:sta:EH_KH}).
One has indeed the \defin{Carter-Robinson theorem}\index{Carter-Robinson theorem}
(Carter\index{Carter, B.} 1971 \cite{Carte71}, Robinson\index{Robinson, D.C.} 1975 \cite{Robin75}):
any stationary and axisymmetric 4-dimensional asymptotically flat
black hole spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ that is
solution of the vacuum Einstein equation with a connected regular
event horizon $\Hor$ and no closed timelike curve outside it
has a domain of outer communications that is isometric
to the domain of outer communications of the Kerr spacetime.

\begin{remark}
In their original works, Carter and Robinson assumed that $\Hor$ is a
\emph{non-degenerate}
Killing horizon, i.e. that the non-affinity coefficient $\kappa$ associated
with the Killing vector $\w{\chi}$ is non-zero (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:neh:classif_KH}). However, this non-degeneracy
hypothesis can be released \cite{ChrusN10} (see \cite{ChrusLH12} for an
extended discussion).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The causality condition (absence of closed timelike curves in the black
hole exterior), which is one of the assumptions of Carter's theorem
(cf. \cite{Carte99} for a discussion), does not appear in Israel's theorem
(Property~\ref{p:sta:Israel_uniqueness_thm}) because a static spacetime, which by definition
has hypersurface-orthogonal timelike curves,
cannot contain any closed timelike curve.
\end{remark}

By combining the staticity, Israel, strong rigidity and Carter-Robinson theorems,
one arrives at the famous
\begin{prop}[no-hair theorem\index{no-hair theorem}]
Any spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ that
\begin{itemize}
\item is 4-dimensional
\item is asymptotically flat
\item is stationary
\item is a solution of the vacuum Einstein equation
\item contains a black hole with a connected regular horizon
\item does not contain any closed timelike curve in the domain of outer
communications
\item is analytic
\end{itemize}
has a domain of outer communications that is isometric
to the domain of outer communications of the Kerr spacetime.
\end{prop}
