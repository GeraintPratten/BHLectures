\subsection{The mass variation formula}

Let us consider an initially isolated Kerr black hole, of parameters $(m,a)$,
that is perturbed by the arrival of some external body or some gravitational
radiation. After some transitory dynamical regime (e.g. absorption of the
external body and emission of gravitational waves), the black hole relaxes
to a new equilibrium configuration. According to the
no-hair theorem (Sec.~\ref{s:sta:no-hair}),
the final state has to be a Kerr black hole, of
parameters $(m+\D m, a+\D a)$ say.
Let us investigate how the black hole global properties evolve during the
process. More precisely, we would like to relate the change
in the Komar mass $M = m$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:M_m})] to the change in
the area $A = 8 \pi m (m + \sqrt{m^2-a^2})$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:A_a_m})]
and in the angular momentum $J = a m$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:J_am})].

Rewriting Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:A_a_m}) as $A = 8 \pi (M^2 + \sqrt{M^4 - J^2})$
and differentiating, we get
\[
\frac{1}{8\pi} \, \D A =  2 M\,  \D M + \frac{2M^3}{\sqrt{M^4-J^2}}\, \D M
    - \frac{J}{\sqrt{M^4-J^2}}\, \D J ,
\]
or equivalently
\[
    \D M = \frac{1}{8\pi}
\underbrace{\frac{\sqrt{M^4-J^2}}{2M(M^2+\sqrt{M^4-J^2})}}_{\kappa} \, \D A
+ \underbrace{\frac{J}{2M(M^2+\sqrt{M^4-J^2})}}_{\Omega_H} \, \D J  ,
\]
where the identification of the black hole's surface gravity $\kappa$ and
rotation velocity $\Omega_H$ results from Eqs.~(\ref{e:ker:kappa_m_a})
and (\ref{e:ker:def_OmegaH}). Hence we get
\be \label{e:evo:mass_variation}
    \encadre{ \D M = \frac{\kappa}{8\pi} \, \D A + \Omega_H \, \D J } .
\ee
\begin{remark}
The mass variation formula (\ref{e:evo:mass_variation}) is \emph{not}
the mere differential of the Smarr formula (\ref{e:ker:Smarr}). Indeed, differentiating
the latter yields
\[
    \D M = \frac{\kappa}{4\pi} \, \D A +  \frac{A}{4\pi} \, \D \kappa
        + 2 \Omega_H \, \D J  + 2 J \, \D\Omega_H ,
\]
with $\D\kappa \neq 0$ and $\D\Omega_H\neq 0$ in the process
that makes the Kerr black hole evolve from $(m,a)$ to $(m+\D m, a+\D a)$.
If one were (wrongly) assuming that $\D\kappa = 0$ and $\D\Omega_H = 0$, one would
be wrong by a factor of 2 in recovering the right-hand side of
Eq.~(\ref{e:evo:mass_variation}).
