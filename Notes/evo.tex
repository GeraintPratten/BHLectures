\section{Towards the first law of black hole dynamics}

\subsection{Mass variation formula for Kerr black holes}

In this section, we assume 4-dimensional general relativity.
Let us consider an initially isolated Kerr black hole, of parameters $(m,a)$,
that is perturbed by the arrival of some external body or some gravitational
radiation. After some transitory dynamical regime (e.g. absorption of the
external body and emission of gravitational waves), the black hole relaxes
to a new equilibrium configuration. According to the
no-hair theorem (Property~\ref{p:sta:no-hair_thm}, Sec.~\ref{s:sta:no-hair}),
the final state has to be a Kerr black hole, of
parameters $(m+\D m, a+\D a)$ say.
Let us investigate how the black hole global properties evolve during the
process. More precisely, we would like to relate the change
in the Komar mass $M = m$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:M_m})] to the change in
the area $A = 8 \pi m (m + \sqrt{m^2-a^2})$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:A_a_m})]
and in the angular momentum $J = a m$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:J_am})].

Rewriting Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:A_a_m}) as $A = 8 \pi (M^2 + \sqrt{M^4 - J^2})$
and differentiating, we get
\[
\frac{1}{8\pi} \, \D A =  2 M\,  \D M + \frac{2M^3}{\sqrt{M^4-J^2}}\, \D M
    - \frac{J}{\sqrt{M^4-J^2}}\, \D J ,
\]
or equivalently
\[
    \D M = \frac{1}{8\pi}
\underbrace{\frac{\sqrt{M^4-J^2}}{2M(M^2+\sqrt{M^4-J^2})}}_{\kappa} \, \D A
+ \underbrace{\frac{J}{2M(M^2+\sqrt{M^4-J^2})}}_{\Omega_{\Hor}} \, \D J  ,
\]
where the identifications of the black hole's surface gravity $\kappa$ and
rotation velocity $\Omega_{\Hor}$ result from Eqs.~(\ref{e:ker:kappa_m_a})
and (\ref{e:ker:def_OmegaH}) respectively. Hence we get
\be \label{e:evo:mass_variation}
    \encadre{ \D M = \frac{\kappa}{8\pi} \, \D A + \Omega_{\Hor} \, \D J } .
\ee
\begin{remark}
The mass variation formula (\ref{e:evo:mass_variation}) is \emph{not}
the mere differential of the Smarr formula (\ref{e:ker:Smarr}). Indeed, differentiating
the latter yields
\[
    \D M = \frac{\kappa}{4\pi} \, \D A +  \frac{A}{4\pi} \, \D \kappa
        + 2 \Omega_{\Hor} \, \D J  + 2 J \, \D\Omega_{\Hor} ,
\]
with $\D\kappa \neq 0$ and $\D\Omega_{\Hor}\neq 0$ in the process
that makes the Kerr black hole evolve from $(m,a)$ to $(m+\D m, a+\D a)$.
If one were (wrongly) assuming that $\D\kappa = 0$ and $\D\Omega_{\Hor} = 0$, one would
be wrong by a factor of 2 in recovering the right-hand side of
Eq.~(\ref{e:evo:mass_variation}). Of course, if ones
expresses properly $\D\kappa$ and $\D\Omega_{\Hor}$ in terms of
$\D A$, $\D J$ and $\D M$ via expressions (\ref{e:ker:kappa_m_a})
and (\ref{e:ker:def_OmegaH}), one recovers Eq.~(\ref{e:evo:mass_variation}).
\end{remark}

\subsection{General mass variation formula} \label{s:evo:gen_mass_variation}

The mass variation formula (\ref{e:evo:mass_variation}) can be derived in
a more general framework, without assuming that it describes changes between
two nearby Kerr solutions \cite{BardeCH73,Carte79} and without restricting
the spacetime dimension to 4. It even holds
for gravitation theories other than general relativity, more specifically
for any theory based on a diffeomorphism-covariant lagrangian; see Wald's review
article~\cite{Wald01} for details.

Here we establish the mass variation formula for quasi-stationary black holes,
from integral mass formulas obtained in Chap.~\ref{s:sta}.

... TO BE COMPLETED ...


\begin{hist}
The mass-variation formula (\ref{e:evo:mass_variation}) for Kerr black holes
has been first
derived by Jacob Bekenstein\index[pers]{Bekenstein, J.D.}
in 1973 \cite{Beken73a}. Its extension to generic stationary black hole configurations
(Sec.~\ref{s:evo:gen_mass_variation}) has been
obtained by James Bardeen\index[pers]{Bardeen, J.M.}, Brandon Carter\index[pers]{Carter, B.}
and Stephen Hawking\index[pers]{Hawking, S.W.} in 1973 \cite{BardeCH73}.
\end{hist}



\subsection{A first law?}

At this stage, it would be premature to call formula~(\ref{e:evo:mass_variation})
the first law of black hole dynamics by analogy to the first law of thermodynamics
$\D E = T \D S - P \D V$. One can reasonably interpret $\D M$
as some energy variation and the term
$\Omega_{\Hor} \, \D J$ as the work\footnote{In Newtonian mechanics, the
work done by a torque $\tau$ during the time $\D t$ by which a body is rotating by $\D\ph$
is $\D W = \tau \, \D\ph$. Given that $\tau := \D J/\D t$, one gets $\D W = \Omega \, \D J$, where
$\Omega = \D\ph/\D t$ is the body's angular velocity.} performed by the torque
that is changing by the amount $\D J$ the angular momentum of a body rotating
at the angular velocity $\Omega_{\Hor}$. However, we do not have any argument yet to
to identify the term $(\kappa/8\pi) \, \D A$ with the classical heat exchange term $T\D S$.
For this, we need first to identify the entropy $S$ with the black hole area $A$.
This will be performed in the next section.

\section{Evolution of the area of a black hole}

\subsection{Hawking's area theorem}

The first step towards the area theorem is:

\begin{prop}[positive expansion of a black hole horizon]
\label{p:evo:positive_expansion}
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a $n$-dimensional spacetime containing a black hole
of event horizon $\Hor$. If the Ricci tensor $\w{R}$ obeys the null
energy condition (\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond}) on $\Hor$, i.e. if
$\w{R}(\wl, \wl) \geq 0$ for any null vector $\wl$ on $\Hor$, then the
expansion $\theta_{(\wl)}$ of $\Hor$ along any future-directed null
normal $\wl$, as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:def:def_expansion}, is positive or zero:
\be \label{e:evo:theta_positive}
    \theta_{(\wl)} \geq 0 .
\ee
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $\wl$ be a future-directed null normal vector field of $\Hor$.
$\wl$ is necessarily tangent to the null geodesic geodesic generators of $\Hor$
(Property~\ref{p:def:null_geod_generators}) and is thus a pregeodesic
vector, i.e. it obeys Eq.~(\ref{e:def:wl_geod_kappa}):
$\wnab_{\wl}\, \wl = \kappa \, \wl $.
If $\wl$ is not geodesic ($\kappa\neq 0$), it is always possible to rescale it
to $\wl' = \alpha \wl$ with $\alpha > 0$ so that $\wl'$ is a geodesic vector field:
$\wnab_{\wl'}\, \wl' = 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:def:wlp_geod})].
We have then $\theta_{(\wl')} = \alpha \theta_{(\wl)}$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:def:rescale_lambda})],
so that $\theta_{(\wl)} \geq 0 \iff \theta_{(\wl')} \geq 0$.
Accordingly, for proving (\ref{e:evo:theta_positive}), there is no loss of generality in assuming that
$\wl$ is a geodesic vector field.
Let us consider a null geodesic generator $\Li$ of $\Hor$. Up to some additive constant, there is
a unique affine parameter $\lambda$ of $\Li$ associated to $\wl$, i.e.  such that
$\wl = \D\w{x}/\D\lambda$ along $\Li$. The evolution of
$\theta_{(\wl)}$ along $\Li$
is measured by $\D\theta_{(\wl)}/\D\lambda = \wnab_{\el}\,  \theta_{(\wl)}$ and is given by
the null Raychaudhuri equation (\ref{e:def:null_Raychaud_Ricci}).
Owing to $\kappa=0$ (for $\wl$ is assumed to be a geodesic vector field), it simplifies to
\[
    \derd{\theta_{(\wl)}}{\lambda}  =
        - \frac{1}{n-2} \, \theta_{(\wl)}^2
        - \underbrace{\sigma_{ab} \sigma^{ab}}_{\geq 0}
        - \underbrace{\w{R}(\wl, \wl)}_{\geq 0} ,
\]
where $\sigma_{ab} \sigma^{ab} \geq 0$ has been established in Sec.~\ref{s:neh:NEH_Theta_zero}
[Eq.~(\ref{e:neh:sigma_square})] and $\w{R}(\wl, \wl) \geq 0$ by virtue of the null
energy condition on $\Hor$. Hence
\be \label{e:evo:der_theta_lower}
    \derd{\theta_{(\wl)}}{\lambda}  \leq
        - \frac{1}{n-2} \, \theta_{(\wl)}^2  .
\ee
Let us assume that at some point $p\in\Li\cap\Hor$, $\theta_{(\wl)} = \theta_0 < 0$.
By choosing the additive constant in the definition of the affine parameter $\lambda$,
we may ensure $\lambda(p) = 0$.
Equation~(\ref{e:evo:der_theta_lower}) implies then
\be \label{e:evo:theta_lower_theta_bar}
 \forall \lambda\geq 0,\quad \theta_{(\wl)}(\lambda) \leq \bar\theta(\lambda) ,
\ee
where $\bar\theta(\lambda)$ obeys
\[
    \frac{\D\bar\theta}{\D\lambda} = -  \frac{1}{n-2}  \bar\theta^2
    \qand \bar\theta(0) = \theta_0 .
\]
The unique solution of this differential equation is
\[
\bar\theta(\lambda) = \frac{\theta_0}{1 + \theta_0\lambda/(n-2)} .
\]
It follows that $\bar\theta \to -\infty$ as $\lambda \to -(n-2)/\theta_0 > 0$.
The inequality~(\ref{e:evo:theta_lower_theta_bar}) then implies
$\theta_{(\wl)} \to -\infty$ as $\lambda \to \lambda_*$
with $0 < \lambda_* \leq -(n-2)/\theta_0$. Hence the point $p_*\in\Li$ of parameter $\lambda_*$ is a \emph{focusing point},
i.e. a point where neighbouring null geodesic generators of $\Hor$ intersect.
But according to Property~\ref{p:glo:prop3} of black hole event horizons (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:properties_H}), this can happen
only if $p_*$ is a crossover point, i.e.
a point at which the null geodesic $\Li$ arrives in $\Hor$; however,
this situation is excluded since $\lambda_* > 0$ implies that $p_*$ lies in the
future of $p$, where $\Li$ is already in $\Hor$. Hence the hypothesis
$\theta_0 < 0$ has lead us to a contradiction. It follows that $\theta_0 \geq 0$,
i.e. at any point $p\in\Hor$,  $\theta_{(\wl)} \geq 0$.
\end{proof}

generators of $\Hor$ (green curves).}

\begin{prop}[area theorem \textnormal{(Hawking\index[pers]{Hawking, S.W.} 1971 \cite{Hawki71})}]
Let $(\M,\w{g})$ be a $n$-dimensional spacetime containing a black hole
of event horizon $\Hor$ and such that the Ricci tensor $\w{R}$ fulfils the null
energy condition (\ref{e:neh:null_energy_cond}), i.e.
$\w{R}(\wl, \wl) \geq 0$ for any null vector $\wl$.
Let $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ be spacelike hypersurfaces
such that $\Sigma_2$ lies in the causal future of $\Sigma_1$: $\Sigma_2\subset J^+(\Sigma_1)$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:causal_struct}). Let $\Sp_1 = \Hor \cap \Sigma_1$
and $\Sp_2 = \Hor\cap\Sigma_2$.
If
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $\Hor$ is smooth between $\Sp_1$ and $\Sp_2$ and $\Sp_1$ and $\Sp_2$
are cross-sections\footnote{If $\Hor$ is smooth between $\Sp_1$ and $\Sp_2$,
it is necessarily a null hypersurface there (Property~\ref{p:glo:prop4} on p.~\pageref{p:glo:prop4}),
so that the concept of cross-section as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:def:spacelike_sections}
makes sense.} of $\Hor$ that are intersected by the same null geodesic generators of $\Hor$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:evo:area_thm_smooth})
\end{itemize}
or
\begin{itemize}
\item[(ii)]
the closure of $J^-(\scri^+)\cup \Hor$ in
the conformal manifold $\tilde{\M}\supset\M$ defining $\scri^+$
is included in a globally hyperbolic
region $\mathscr{V}$ of $(\tilde{\M},\tilde{\w{g}})$
and $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are Cauchy surfaces
of $\mathscr{V}$,
\end{itemize}
then the areas $A(\Sp_1)$ and $A(\Sp_2)$ obey
\be \label{e:evo:AS2_ge_AS1}
    A(\Sp_2) \geq A(\Sp_1) .
\ee
\end{prop}

light green dots); the part of these geodesics outside $\Hor$ is drawn as
a light green dashed curve. The dark green dashed curves depict other null geodesics that
enter $\Hor$ at the same caustic points.}
\end{figure}


\begin{proof}
Let us consider first the case (i) ($\Hor$ smooth between
$\Sp_1$ and $\Sp_2$).
$\Sp_1$ and $\Sp_2$ are then cross-sections of $\Hor$
that are connected by null null geodesic generators of $\Hor$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:evo:area_thm_smooth}).
One may introduce a 1-parameter foliation $(S_t)_{t\in [0,1]}$ of $\Hor$ by
cross-sections $S_t$ such that $S_0 = \Sp_1$ and $S_1 = \Sp_2$
(cf. the proof of Property~\ref{p:neh:invariance_area} for details, $\lambda'$
playing the role of $t$ there). The label $t$
can then be considered as a parameter along the null geodesic generators of $\Hor$
connecting $\Sp_1$ to $\Sp_2$.
Let $\wl = \D\w{x}/\D t$ be the associated tangent vector.
Given that $\Sp_2$ lies in the future of $\Sp_1$, $\wl$ is future-directed.
By the very definition
of the expansion $\theta_{(\wl)}$ along $\wl$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:def:def_expansion})
combined with Eq.~(\ref{e:def:A_sqrt_q})], one has
\[
    \derd{}{t} A(S_t) = \int_{S_t} \theta_{(\wl)} \,  \sqrt{q} \, \D x^2 \cdots \D x^{n-1} ,
\]
where $(x^2, \ldots, x^{n-1})$ is a coordinate system on $S_t$ and $q$ is
the determinant with respect to these coordinates of the metric
induced by $\w{g}$ on $S_t$.
Now, if the null energy condition holds, Property~\ref{p:evo:positive_expansion} implies
$\theta_{(\wl)} \geq 0$; hence
\[
  \derd{}{t} A(S_t) \geq 0 .
\]
It follows that $t\mapsto A(S_t)$ is a nondecreasing function. Consequently, $A(S_1) \geq A(S_0)$
and Eq.~(\ref{e:evo:AS2_ge_AS1}) holds.

If $\Hor$ is not smooth between $\Sp_1$ and $\Sp_2$, this is due to the crease set\index{crease set},
i.e. the subset of $\Hor$ where new null geodesics enter $\Hor$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:glo:properties_H}).
Naively, this reinforces the inequality $A(\Sp_2) > A(\Sp_1)$ since the new geodesics
are generating new parts of $\Hor$ and therefore additional segments for $\Sp_2$
with respect to those that can be connected to $\Sp_1$ by null geodesic generators
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:evo:area_theorem}). More precisely, let us assume (ii) and
let us consider a point $p\in\Sp_1$. Let $\Li$ be the null geodesic
generator of $\Hor$ through $p$. By property~\ref{p:glo:prop3}, $\Li$ stays in $\Hor$ for all its future after $p$. Since $\Sigma_2$ is a Cauchy surface lying in the causal future of $\Sigma_1$, $\Li$
necessarily intersects $\Sigma_2$ at a unique point $q \in \Sigma_2\cap\Hor = \Sp_2$.
Hence every point of $\Sp_1$ is mapped to a point of $\Sp_2$ by a null geodesic generator.
Let $\Sp_2^*$ be the part of $\Sp_2$ covered by this map. We may apply (i) to the pair $(\Sp_1, \Sp_2^*)$
and get $A(\Sp_2^*) \geq A(\Sp_1)$. Given that $\Sp_2^* \subset \Sp_2$, one has
$A(\Sp_2) \geq A(\Sp_2^*)$ and (\ref{e:evo:AS2_ge_AS1}) follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{hist}
The area theorem has been first established by Stephen Hawking\index[pers]{Hawking, S.W.}
in 1971 \cite{Hawki71} and a detailed proof was given in
Hawking \& Ellis' 1973 textbook (Proposition~9.2.7 in \cite{HawkiE73}).
In 2001, Piotr Chru\'sciel\index[pers]{Chrusciel, P.T.@Chru\'sciel, P.T.},
Erwann Delay\index[pers]{Delay, E.},
Gregory Galloway\index[pers]{Galloway, G.J.} and Ralph Howard\index[pers]{Howard, R.}
\cite{ChrusDGH01} pointed out that the Hawking \& Ellis proof is
valid only for $\Hor$ piecewise smooth (cf. the
discussion in Sec.~3.5.1 of Chru\'sciel's textbook \cite{Chrus20}) and constructed
a new proof that does not assume the smoothness of $\Hor$.
