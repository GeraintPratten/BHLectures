\section{Equations of geodesic motion}

\subsection{Introduction}

In all this chapter, we are concerned by the motion of a particle
$\mathscr{P}$ in Kerr spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$, assuming that $\mathscr{P}$
feels only gravity, as described by $\w{g}$ (freely falling particle).
The worldline $\Li$ of $\mathscr{P}$
is then necessarily a geodesic\footnote{The definition and basic properties of geodesics
are recalled in Appendix~\ref{s:geo}; see also Sec.~\ref{s:fra:geod_motion}.} of
$(\M,\w{g})$. It is a timelike geodesic if $\mathscr{P}$ is a massive particle
and a null geodesic if $\mathscr{P}$ is massless (e.g. a photon).

In a given coordinate system $(x^\alpha)$, the geodesic $\Li$ is described
by a system of the form\footnote{In Appendices~\ref{s:bas} and \ref{s:geo},
we use a different notation for the function $X^\alpha(\lambda)$ defining
$\Li$ and the coordinate $x^\alpha$ (cf. Secs.~\ref{s:bas:vectors} and
\ref{s:geo:geodesic_eq}). Following standard usage in the physics literature,
we shall not do this here.}
$x^\alpha = x^\alpha(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is an
affine parameter\footnote{See Sec.~\ref{s:geo:def} for the definition
of an affine parameter along a geodesic.} along $\Li$. We choose $\lambda$ to be the affine parameter
associated with $\mathscr{P}$'s 4-momentum $\w{p}$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:p_dxdl})]. We have
then $\D x^\alpha / \D\lambda = p^\alpha$.
The curve $\Li$ is a geodesic iff the functions $x^\alpha(\lambda)$ obey
the geodesic equation [Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:eq_geod}) in Appendix~\ref{s:geo}]:
\be \label{e:gek:eq_geod}
    \frac{\D^2 x^\alpha}{\D\lambda^2} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu}
    \frac{\D x^\mu}{\D\lambda} \frac{\D x^\nu}{\D\lambda} = 0 ,
\ee
where the $\Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu}$'s are the Christoffel symbols\index{Christoffel symbols} of the metric $\w{g}$
with respect to the coordinates $(x^\alpha)$, as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:Christoffel}).
Equation~(\ref{e:gek:eq_geod}) is actually a system of four coupled second-order
differential equations, that are non-linear. We are going to see that in
order to compute the geodesics of Kerr spacetime, it is not necessary to
solve this system, since, as in the Schwarzschild case studied in Chap.~\ref{s:ges}, we have
enough first integrals of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:eq_geod}) to reduce
the problem to four first-order equations
of the type $\D x^\alpha/\D\lambda = F^\alpha(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$.

Three integrals of motion are similar to those in the Schwarzschild case.
One is the particle's mass $\mu$ (Sec.~\ref{s:gek:mass_int_motion} below)
and the two other ones are
the conserved energy $E$ and the conserved angular momentum
$L$ (Sec.~\ref{s:gek:int_motion_sym}), which arise from the common symmetries
of Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes: stationarity (outside the ergosphere) and axisymmetry.
In the Schwarzschild case, the fourth integral of motion was provided by
spherical symmetry, which constrained all geodesics to be planar, so that
a suitable choice of
coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ makes a given geodesic confined to the
hyperplane $\th=\pi/2$, yielding the first integral $p^\th=0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:pth_zero})].
The Kerr spacetime with $a\not=0$ being not spherically symmetric, we loose
this property here. Fortunaly there exists another
integral of motion: the Carter constant; it arises from a remarkable property
of Kerr spacetime: the existence of a non-trivial Killing tensor (Sec.~\ref{s:gek:Carter_const}).
With the particle mass $\mu$, this makes a total of four integral of motions,
which renders the problem integrable (Sec.~\ref{s:gek:first_order_system}).


\subsection{Integrals of motion from spacetime symmetries} \label{s:gek:int_motion_sym}

As for Schwarzschild spacetime (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ges:fiom}), we have the following
property.
\begin{greybox}
The Killing vectors $\w{\xi}$ and $\w{\eta}$ of Kerr spacetime,
associated respectively with
stationarity and axisymmetry [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_xi_eta})],
give birth to two conserved quantities
along the geodesic $\Li$:
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:def_E_L}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{E := - \w{\xi}\cdot \w{p} = - \w{g}(\w{\xi},\w{p}) } \label{e:gek:def_E} \\
& \encadre{L := \w{\eta}\cdot \w{p} = \w{g}(\w{\eta},\w{p}) } , \label{e:gek:def_L}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\w{p}$ is the 4-momentum of particle $\mathscr{P}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:fra:worldlines}).
For the same reasons as in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:fiom}, $E$ is called
the \defin{conserved energy}\index{conserved!energy}\index{energy!conserved --}
or \defin{energy at infinity}\index{energy!at infinity} of $\mathscr{P}$,
while $L$ is called $\mathscr{P}$'s \defin{conserved angular momentum}\index{conserved!angular momentum}\index{angular momentum!conserved --}
or \defin{angular momentum at infinity}\index{angular momentum!at infinity}
of $\mathscr{P}$.
\end{greybox}
\begin{remark}
Asymptotically, the scalar $L$ is only the
component along the rotation axis of $\mathscr{P}$'s angular momentum vector $\w{L}$
as measured by an inertial observer at rest with respect to the black hole.
For this reason, it is sometimes denoted by $L_z$, instead of merely $L$.
\end{remark}

In coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ adapted to the spacetime symmetries,
i.e. coordinates such that $\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$ and $\w{\eta}=\wpar_\ph$,
for instance Boyer-Lindquist coordinates (Sec.~\ref{s:ker:expr_BL}),
Kerr coordinates (Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Kerr_coord}) or 3+1 Kerr coordinates
(Sec.~\ref{s:ker:3p1_Kerr_coord}), one can rewrite
(\ref{e:gek:def_E_L})
in terms of the components $p_t = g_{t\mu} \, p^\mu$ and $p_\ph = g_{\ph\mu} \, p^\mu$
of the 1-form $\uu{p}$ associated to $\w{p}$ by metric duality:
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:E_pt_L_pph}
\begin{align}
& E = - p_t \\
& L = p_\ph
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Indeed, in such a coordinate system, $\xi^\mu =  \delta^\mu_{\ \, t}$
and $\eta^\mu = \delta^\mu_{\ \, \ph}$, so that $E = -g_{\mu\nu} \, \xi^\mu p^\nu = -g_{t\nu} \, p^\nu = -p_t$
and $L = g_{\mu\nu} \, \eta^\mu p^\nu = g_{\ph\nu} \, p^\nu = p_\ph$.

In what follows, we are going to use Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
$(x^\alpha)=(t,r,\th,\ph)$
as introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:expr_BL}.
Given the components (\ref{e:ker:metric_BL}) of the metric tensor $\w{g}$
in these coordinates, evaluating $E$ and $L$
via $E = - g_{t\mu} \, p^\mu$ and $L = g_{\ph\mu} \, p^\mu$ yields
\be \label{e:gek:E_first_int}
    E = \left( 1 - \frac{2 m r}{\rho^2} \right)\,  p^t
        + \frac{2 a m r \sin^2\th}{\rho^2}\,  p^\ph  .
\ee
\be \label{e:gek:L_first_int}
    L = - \frac{2 a m r \sin^2\th}{\rho^2} \, p^t
        + \left( r^2 + a^2 + \frac{2 a^2 m r \sin^2\th}{\rho^2} \right)
    \sin^2\th \,  p^\ph ,
\ee
where $\rho^2 := r^2 + a^2 \cos^2\th$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_rho2})].

Let us recall that the components $(p^\alpha)$ of the 4-momentum are
related to the equation $x^\alpha = x^\alpha(\lambda)$ of the geodesic $\Li$
in terms of the affine parameter $\lambda$ by $p^\alpha = \D x^\alpha / \D\lambda$
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:p_dxdl})], i.e.
\be \label{e:gek:pa_der_xa}
    p^t = \derd{t}{\lambda},\quad
    p^r = \derd{r}{\lambda},\quad
    p^\th = \derd{\th}{\lambda},\quad
    p^\ph = \derd{\ph}{\lambda} .
\ee

\subsection{Mass as an integral of motion} \label{s:gek:mass_int_motion}

The mass $\mu$ of particle $\mathscr{P}$ is related to the scalar square of
the 4-momentum vector $\w{p}$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:def_mass}):
\be \label{e:gek:mu_gpp}
    \mu^2 = - \w{g}(\w{p}, \w{p}) .
\ee
The fact that $\Li$ is a geodesic implies that $\mu$ is a constant along
$\Li$ (cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:vv_const}) in Appendix~\ref{s:geo}). It therefore
provides a third integral of motion, after $E$ and $L$.

It is convenient to express (\ref{e:gek:mu_gpp}) in terms of the inverse metric
in order to let appear $p_t = -E$ and $p_\ph = L$:
\[
    \mu^2 = - g^{\mu\nu} p_\mu p_\nu .
\]

Given the components (\ref{e:ker:inv_met_BL}) of the inverse metric
in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we get
\bea
    \mu^2 & = & \frac{1}{\Delta}
    \left( r^2 + a^2 + \frac{2 a^2 m r \sin^2\th}{\rho^2} \right) E^2
    -\frac{4 a m r}{\rho^2 \Delta} E L
    - \frac{1}{\Delta}\left(1 - \frac{2 m r}{\rho^2} \right) \frac{L^2}{\sin^2\th}
    \nonumber \\
   &  & - \frac{\rho^2}{\Delta} \left( p^r \right) ^2
    - \rho^2 \left( p^\theta \right) ^2 ,   \label{e:gek:mu2_first_int}
\eea
where $\Delta := r^2 - 2 m r + a^2$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_Delta})].
Note that we have expressed $p_r$ and $p_\th$ in terms of $p^r$ and $p^\th$
thanks to the relations $p_r = g_{r\mu} p^\mu$ and $p_\th = g_{\th\mu} p^\mu$,
which are very simple for the Boyer-Lindquist components (\ref{e:ker:metric_BL})
of $\w{g}$:
\be \label{e:gek:p_r_p_th_cov_con}
    p_r = \frac{\rho^2}{\Delta} \, p^r
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    p_\th = \rho^2 \, p^\th .
\ee

\subsection{The fourth integral of motion: Carter constant} \label{s:gek:Carter_const}

It turns out that the Kerr spacetime is endowed with a non-trivial
Killing tensor of valence 2: the
\defin{Walker-Penrose Killing tensor}\index{Killing!tensor!Walker-Penrose --}\index{Walker-Penrose Killing tensor} $\w{K}$, which is the symmetric tensor of type
$(0,2)$ defined by
\be \label{e:gek:def_K}
    \encadre{ \w{K} := (r^2 + a^2) \left( \uu{k} \otimes \uu{\el} + \uu{\el} \otimes \uu{k} \right) + r^2 \w{g} } ,
\ee
where $\uu{\el}$ and $\uu{k}$ are the 1-forms associated by metric duality
to the null vector fields $\w{k}$ and $\wl$ tangent to the principal null
geodesics introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:principal_geod}. In index notation,
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_K}) writes
\be
    K_{\alpha\beta} = (r^2 + a^2) \left(k_\alpha \el_\beta + \el_\alpha k_\beta \right)
        + r^2 g_{\alpha\beta} .
\ee
$\w{K}$ is called a \defin{Killing tensor}\index{Killing!tensor} because its symmetrized covariant derivative vanishes identically:
\be \label{e:gek:Killing_eq_K}
    \encadre{ \nabla_{(\alpha} K_{\beta\gamma)} = 0 }.
\ee
This property can be seen as a generalization of the Killing equation
(\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}) to tensors of valence 2.
That the tensor $\w{K}$ defined by (\ref{e:gek:def_K}) obeys the Killing
identity (\ref{e:gek:Killing_eq_K}) is shown in the notebook~\ref{s:sam:Kerr_Killing_tensor}.

Killing tensors are discussed in Sec.~\ref{e:geo:Killing_tensor} of Appendix~\ref{s:geo}.
It is shown there that the Killing identity (\ref{e:gek:Killing_eq_K}) implies that
the following quantity is constant along any geodesic $\Li$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:Kvv_const})]:
\be
    \encadre{ \mathscr{K} := \w{K}(\w{p}, \w{p}) = K_{\mu\nu} p^\mu p^\nu } .
\ee
$\mathscr{K}$ is named \defin{Carter constant}\index{Carter!constant}.
From the definition (\ref{e:gek:def_K}) of $\w{K}$, we have
\be \label{e:gek:Kcarter_prov}
    \mathscr{K} = 2(r^2 + a^2) \langle \uu{k}, \w{p} \rangle
        \langle \uu{\el}, \w{p} \rangle + r^2 \w{g}(\w{p}, \w{p}).
\ee
Now by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:mu_gpp}), $\w{g}(\w{p}, \w{p}) = - \mu^2$. Besides, we
have
\[
  \langle \uu{k}, \w{p} \rangle = k_\mu p^\mu = k^\mu p_\mu .
\]
The last form allows us to let appear the constants of motion $p_t = -E$ and
$p_\ph = L$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:E_pt_L_pph})]. Using it with the components
of $\w{k}$ as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:k_BL}), we get
\[
    \langle \uu{k}, \w{p} \rangle = - \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} E
    - p_r + \frac{a}{\Delta} L .
\]
Similarly, from the components (\ref{e:ker:ell_BL}) of $\wl$, we obtain
\[
     \langle \uu{\el}, \w{p} \rangle = - \frac{1}{2} E + \frac{\Delta}{2(r^2 + a^2)} p_r
     + \frac{a}{2(r^2 + a^2)} L .
\]
Accordingly, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_prov}) becomes
\[
    \mathscr{K} = \frac{1}{\Delta} \left[ (r^2 + a^2) E + \Delta p_r - a L \right]
      \left[ (r^2 + a^2) E - \Delta p_r - a L \right] - r^2 \mu^2 ,
\]
which can be rewritten as
\be \label{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int}
   \encadre{ \mathscr{K} = \frac{1}{\Delta} \left[ \left( (r^2 + a^2) E - a L \right)^2
        - \rho^4 (p^r)^2 \right] - r^2 \mu^2 }.
\ee
Note that we have expressed $p_r$ in terms of $p^r$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:p_r_p_th_cov_con}).

We can get some physical interpretation of the Carter constant from the above
expression, in the case where the particle $\mathscr{P}$ following the
geodesic $\Li$ visits the asymptotic region $r\to+\infty$. Indeed, given
that $\Delta := r^2 - 2m r + a^2 \sim r^2$  and $\rho^4 := (r^2 + a^2\cos^2\th)^2 \sim r^4$
as $r\to+\infty$, we deduce from Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int})
that
\be \label{e:gek:Kcarter_r_inf}
    \mathscr{K} \underset{r\to + \infty}{\sim} r^2 \left[ E^2 - \mu^2 - (p^r)^2 \right] .
\ee
Then let $\Obs$ be the asymptotic inertial observer at rest with respect to the
black hole, i.e. the observer with $r\gg m$ and whose 4-velocity
coincides with the Killing vector
$\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$. $E$ is then $\mathscr{P}$'s energy as measured by $\Obs$
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:E_obs}) and (\ref{e:gek:def_E})], so that, according to
Einstein's formula (\ref{e:fra:E2_m2_P2}), $E^2 - \mu^2 = \w{P}\cdot\w{P}$, where
$\w{P}$ is $\mathscr{P}$'s linear momentum as measured by $\Obs$. Given
that asymptotically, $p^r\sim P^r$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:p_E_P})],
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_r_inf}) becomes
\[
    \mathscr{K} \underset{r\to + \infty}{\sim} r^2 \left[ \w{P}\cdot\w{P} - (P^r)^2 \right]
    = r^2 \left[ (P^{(\th)})^2 + (P^{(\ph)})^2 \right],
\]
where $P^{(\th)} = r P^\th \sim r p^\th$ and $P^{(\ph)} = r\sin\th\, P^\ph \sim r\sin\th\, p^\ph$
are the angular components of $\w{P}$ in the
orthonormal basis $(\w{e}_{(r)}, \w{e}_{(\th)}, \w{e}_{(\ph)}) := (\wpar_r, r^{-1} \wpar_\th,
(r\sin\th)^{-1}\wpar_\ph)$.
Now the total angular momentum of $\mathscr{P}$ measured by $\Obs$ is
\[
    \w{L}_{\rm tot} = \w{r} \times \w{P} = - r P^{(\ph)} \w{e}_{(\th)}
        + r P^{(\th)} \w{e}_{(\ph)} .
\]
Hence we may conclude that asymptotically, the Carter constant coincides with
the square of $\w{P}$'s angular momentum as measured by the inertial observer $\Obs$:
\be \label{e:gek:Kcarter_asymptot}
    \mathscr{K} \underset{r\to + \infty}{\sim} \w{L}_{\rm tot} \cdot \w{L}_{\rm tot} .
\ee

\subsection{First order equations of motion} \label{s:gek:first_order_system}

We have thus obtained four first integrals of the geodesic equation
(\ref{e:gek:eq_geod}):
$E$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:E_first_int})], $L$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:L_first_int})],
$\mu^2$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:mu2_first_int})] and $\mathscr{K}$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int})]. In the expressions of each of these integrals,
$p^\alpha$ has to be thought of as the first order derivative $\D x^\alpha/\D\lambda$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:pa_der_xa})].
Two first integrals, namely $E$ and $L$, are linear in the $p^\alpha$'s, while
the two others, namely $\mu^2$ and $\mathscr{K}$, are quadratic.
Furthermore, Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:E_first_int}) and (\ref{e:gek:L_first_int})
constitute a decoupled subsystem for $(p^t, p^\ph)$, which can easily be solved\footnote{An
intermediate step is combining  Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:E_first_int}) and (\ref{e:gek:L_first_int})
to get $a E - L /\sin^2\th = a p^t - (r^2 + a^2) p^\ph$
and $(r^2 + a^2) E - a L = \Delta(p^t - a\sin^2\th p^\ph)$.},
yielding
\be \label{e:gek:rho2_pt}
    \rho^2 p^t = \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} [(r^2 + a^2) E - a L] + a ( L - a E \sin^2\th )
\ee
\be  \label{e:gek:rho2_pph}
    \rho^2 p^\ph = \frac{L}{\sin^2\th} - a E
    + \frac{a}{\Delta}\left[(r^2 + a^2) E - a L\right] .
\ee
Besides, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int}) involves only $p^r$ and can
be recast as
\be \label{e:gek:p_r_R}
    \rho^2 p^r = \eps_r \sqrt{ R(r) } ,
\ee
where $\eps_r := \operatorname{sgn} p^r = \pm 1$ and
$R(r)$ is the following 4th order polynomial of $r$:
\be \label{e:gek:def_R}
   \encadre{ R(r) := \left[ (r^2 + a^2) E - a L \right]^ 2 - \Delta (r^2 \mu^2 + \mathscr{K}) }.
\ee
In the above expression, let us recall that $\Delta$ is the function of $r$
given by Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_Delta}): $\Delta := r^2 - 2 m r + a^2$. All other
quantities are constant.

Finally, if we substitute $p^r$ by the value given by Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:p_r_R})-(\ref{e:gek:def_R}) in the mass first integral (\ref{e:gek:mu2_first_int}), we get, after simplification,
\be \label{e:gek:p_th_Th}
    \rho^2 p^\th = \eps_\th \sqrt{\Theta(\th)} ,
\ee
where $\eps_\th := \operatorname{sgn} p^\th = \pm 1$ and
\be \label{e:gek:def_Theta}
   \encadre{ \Theta(\th) := \mathscr{K} - \left(\frac{L}{\sin\th} - a E \sin\th \right)^2
        - \mu^2 a^2 \cos^2\th } .
\ee
The following constant is often used instead of $\mathscr{K}$:
\be \label{e:gek:def_Q}
    \encadre{Q := \mathscr{K} - (L - a E)^2 }
\ee
Thanks to it, we may rewrite (\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}) as
\be \label{e:gek:Theta_Q}
    \encadre{ \Theta(\th) = Q + \cos^2\th \left[ a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2)
    - \frac{L^2}{\sin^2\th} \right] } .
\ee
Following the standard usage, we call $Q$ the \defin{Carter constant}\index{Carter!constant}
as well. To distinguish between the two Carter constants, we shall specify \emph{Carter constant $Q$}
or \emph{Carter constant $\mathscr{K}$}. As we shall see in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:th_motion},
$Q$ is well adapted to the description of the $\th$-motion of geodesics. On the other
hand, a nice property of $\mathscr{K}$, which is not shared by $Q$, is to be always non-negative,
as Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}) shows (given that $\Theta(\th) \geq 0$ by virtue of
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:p_th_Th})):
\be
    \mathscr{K} \geq 0 .
\ee

If the particle $\mathscr{P}$ reaches the asymptotic region $r\gg m$, we deduce from
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Q}) and (\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_asymptot}) the following approximate
value of $Q$:
\be
   Q \underset{r\to + \infty}{\sim} \w{L}_{\rm tot} \cdot \w{L}_{\rm tot}
    - L^2 + a (2 L - a E^2) .
\ee
Hence, if $a=0$, $Q$ can be interpreted as the square of
the part of $\mathscr{P}$'s angular momentum (measured by the asymptotic inertial
observer) that is not in $L$. Using
notations of Sec.~\ref{s:gek:Carter_const}, we have $L = L_{\rm tot}^{(\ph)}$,
so that $ \w{L}_{\rm tot} \cdot \w{L}_{\rm tot} - L^2 = (L_{\rm tot}^{(\th)})^2$.

\begin{remark}
One may derive the Carter constant $Q$ from a Killing tensor, $\w{\tilde{K}}$ say,
that is related to the Walker-Penrose Killing tensor $\w{K}$ by
\be \label{e:gek:def_tilde_K}
    \w{\tilde{K}} := \w{K} - \uu{\tilde{\eta}}\otimes\uu{\tilde{\eta}} ,
\ee
with
\be
    \w{\tilde{\eta}} := \w{\eta} + a \w{\xi} .
\ee
Being a linear combination with constant coefficients of the Killing vectors
$\w{\eta}$ and $\w{\xi}$, $\w{\tilde{\eta}}$ is itself a Killing vector.
It follows that $\uu{\tilde{\eta}}\otimes\uu{\tilde{\eta}}$ is a Killing tensor
(cf. Example~\ref{x:geo:trivial_Killing_tensors} in Sec.~\ref{e:geo:Killing_tensor}),
so that (\ref{e:gek:def_tilde_K}) does define a Killing tensor. Applying it to the
4-momentum $\w{p}$, we get
\[
    \w{\tilde{K}}(\w{p},\w{p}) =  \underbrace{\w{K}(\w{p},\w{p})}_{\mathscr{K}}
        - (\underbrace{\langle\uu{\eta},\w{p}\rangle}_{L}
        + a \underbrace{\langle\uu{\xi},\w{p}\rangle}_{-E})^2 .
\]
Comparing with the definition (\ref{e:gek:def_Q}), we conclude that
\be
    Q = \w{\tilde{K}}(\w{p},\w{p}) .
\ee
As a side remark, we note that
the Boyer-Lindquist components of the contravariant tensor associated to $\w{\tilde{K}}$ by
metric duality have an expression particularly simple in terms of those of
the inverse metric (cf. the notebook~\ref{s:sam:Kerr_Killing_tensor}):
\be
    \tilde{K}^{\alpha\beta} = - a^2 \cos^2 \theta \, g^{\alpha\beta}
    + \operatorname{diag}(-a^2\cos^2\theta, 0, 1, \tan^{-2}\theta)^{\alpha\beta} .
\ee
\end{remark}

In view of the relation (\ref{e:gek:pa_der_xa}) between the $p^\alpha$'s
and the derivatives of the functions $x^\alpha(\lambda)$, we may
collect Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:rho2_pt}), (\ref{e:gek:rho2_pph}), (\ref{e:gek:p_r_R})
and (\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}) as the first-order system
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:eom_first_order}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{ \rho^2 \derd{t}{\lambda} = \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} [(r^2 + a^2) E - a L] + a ( L - a E \sin^2\th ) } \label{e:gek:dtdl} \\
& \encadre{ \rho^2 \derd{r}{\lambda} = \eps_r \sqrt{ R(r) } } \label{e:gek:drdl}\\
& \encadre{ \rho^2 \derd{\th}{\lambda} = \eps_\th \sqrt{\Theta(\th)} } \label{e:gek:dthdl}\\
& \encadre{ \rho^2 \derd{\ph}{\lambda}  = \frac{L}{\sin^2\th} - a E
    + \frac{a}{\Delta}\left[(r^2 + a^2) E - a L\right] } . \label{e:gek:dphdl}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The functions $R(r)$ and $\Theta(\th)$ are defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_R})
and Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}) or (\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}). They must obey
\be \label{e:gek:R_Theta_positive}
    R(r) \geq 0 \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad \Theta(\th) \geq 0 .
\ee
Note that besides the constants of motion $E$, $L$, $\mu$ and $\mathscr{K}$
or $Q$, $R(r)$ depends on $a$ and $m$ (via $\Delta$), while $\Theta(\th)$
depends on $a$ only.

In the system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order}), $\eps_r$
is $+1$ (resp. $-1$) in the parts of the geodesic $\Li$ where $r$ increases
(resp. decreases) with $\lambda$. Similarly, $\eps_\th$
is $+1$ (resp. $-1$) in the parts of $\Li$ where $\th$ increases
(resp. decreases) with $\lambda$.

\subsection{Turning points} \label{s:gek:turning_points}

Let $\Li$ be a geodesic that is not sticked at a constant value of the
coordinate $r$.
We define a \defin{radial turning point}\index{radial!turning point}\index{turning point!radial --} of $\Li$ as a point $p_0\in\Li$, the $r$-coordinate $r_0$ of which obeys
\be \label{e:gek:def_r_turning}
    R(r_0) = 0 \quad\mbox{and}\quad R'(r_0) \neq 0 ,
\ee
i.e. $r_0$ is a single zero of the polynomial $R$.

We have then
\be \label{e:gek:der_r_turning}
   \left. \derd{r}{\lambda} \right| _{\lambda_0} = 0
   \quad\mbox{and}\quad
   \left. \frac{\D^2 r}{\D\lambda^2} \right| _{\lambda_0} = \frac{R'(r_0)}{2\rho_0^4} \neq 0 ,
\ee
where $\lambda_0$ is the value of the affine parameter $\lambda$ at $p_0$
and $\rho_0 := \rho(p_0)$.
\begin{proof}
The vanishing of $\D r/\D\lambda$ at $\lambda_0$ follows immediately
from Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) with $R(r_0)=0$, since $\rho^2$ never vanishes
on $\M$. Besides, by
taking the derivative of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) with respect to $\lambda$, we
get
\[
    2 \left(r \derd{r}{\lambda} + a^2 \cos\th\sin\th \derd{\th}{\lambda} \right)
    \derd{r}{\lambda} + \rho^2 \frac{\D^2 r}{\D\lambda^2} =
    \eps_r \frac{R'(r)}{2\sqrt{R(r)}} \derd{r}{\lambda} = \frac{R'(r)}{2\rho^2} .
\]
At $\lambda=\lambda_0$, the first term in left-hand side vanishes identically,
due to the $\D r/\D\lambda$ factor,
and we get the second part of (\ref{e:gek:der_r_turning}).
\end{proof}

We deduce from the result (\ref{e:gek:der_r_turning}) that at $\lambda=\lambda_0$,
$\D r/\D\lambda$ moves from positive to negative values or vice-versa
(depending on the sign of $R'(r_0)$), which means that the function $r(\lambda)$
switches from increasing to decreasing or vice-versa, hence the name \emph{radial
turning point}. The factor $\eps_r=\pm 1$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) necessarily
changes sign at $\lambda=\lambda_0$.

\begin{remark} \label{r:gek:der_r_analytic}
For a generic analytic function $r(\lambda)$ with $\D r/\D \lambda=0$ at
$\lambda_0$, the condition $\D^2 r/\D\lambda^2\neq 0$ at $\lambda_0$
is sufficient but not necessary for having $r$ change its direction of variation there.
Indeed, one can have the same property with $\D^2 r/\D\lambda^2= 0$ and higher order derivatives vanishing up to some even order $k$ for which
$\D^k r/\D\lambda^k\neq 0$. However, in the present case,
$\D^2 r/\D\lambda^2=0$ would imply $R'(r_0)=0$ and we shall see
Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values} that a geodesic can reach such a point only asymptotically,
i.e. for $\lambda\to +\infty$. Hence it cannot be a turning point.
\end{remark}


Similarly, if $\Li$ is a geodesic that is not sticked at a constant value of the
coordinate $\th$, we define a \defin{latitudinal turning point}\index{latitudinal!turning point}\index{turning point!latitudinal --} of $\Li$ as a point $p_0\in\Li$, the
$\th$-coordinate $\th_0$ of which obeys
\be \label{e:gek:def_th_turning}
    \Theta(\th_0) = 0 \quad\mbox{and}\quad \Theta'(\theta_0) \neq 0 .
\ee
We deduce then from the equation of motion (\ref{e:gek:dthdl}):
\be \label{e:gek:der_th_turning}
   \left. \derd{\th}{\lambda} \right| _{\lambda_0} = 0
   \quad\mbox{and}\quad
   \left. \frac{\D^2 \th}{\D\lambda^2} \right| _{\lambda_0} = \frac{\Theta'(\th_0)}{2\rho_0^4} \neq 0 .
\ee
This implies that at a latitudinal turning point, the function $\th(\lambda)$
switches from increasing to decreasing or vice-versa. The factor $\eps_\th=\pm 1$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dthdl}) necessarily
changes sign at such a point.

\begin{remark}
A comment similar to Remark~\ref{r:gek:der_r_analytic} can be made:
a geodesic with varying $\th$ that has $\D\th/\D\lambda = 0$ for some finite
value of $\lambda$
cannot have $\D^2\th/\D\lambda^2 = 0$ at the same point, since we shall see
in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values}
that a value of $\th$ with both $\Theta(\th)=0$
and $\Theta'(\th)=0$ can only be reached asymptotically along a geodesic.
Hence (\ref{e:gek:def_th_turning})
is a necessary and sufficient condition for a latitudinal turning point.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Equations of motion in terms of Mino time} \label{s:gek:Mino_time}

In view of the right-hand sides of the system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order}),
it is quite natural to introduce along the geodesic $\Li$ the new
parameter $\lambda'$ defined by
\be \label{e:gek:def_Mino_time}
    \D\lambda' = \frac{\D\lambda}{\rho^2}
     = \frac{\D\lambda}{r(\lambda)^2 + a^2 \cos^2 \th(\lambda)} .
\ee
Since $\rho^2$ never vanishes on the spacetime manifold $\M$ (by construction
of the latter, cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_M_Kerr_spacetime})), the above relation
leads to a well-defined parameter along $\Li$. Moreover, since $\rho^2>0$, this
parameter increases towards the future, as $\lambda$. A difference between
the two parametrizations is that $\lambda'$ is not in general\footnote{The only
exception is for a circurlar orbit at constant $\theta$, since then $\rho^2$
is constant and Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Mino_time}) defines an affine relation
between $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$.} an affine parameter
of $\Li$, contrary to $\lambda$.
The parameter $\lambda'$ is called \defin{Mino time}\index{Mino!time}\index{time!Mino --}
\cite{Mino03}.

In terms of Mino time, the system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order}) becomes
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:eom_Mino}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{ \derd{t}{\lambda'} = \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} [(r^2 + a^2) E - a L] + a ( L - a E \sin^2\th ) } \label{e:gek:dtdl_Mino} \\
& \encadre{ \derd{r}{\lambda'} = \eps_r \sqrt{ R(r) } } \label{e:gek:drdl_Mino}\\
& \encadre{ \derd{\th}{\lambda'} = \eps_\th \sqrt{\Theta(\th)} } \label{e:gek:dthdl_Mino}\\
& \encadre{ \derd{\ph}{\lambda'}  = \frac{L}{\sin^2\th} - a E
    + \frac{a}{\Delta}\left[(r^2 + a^2) E - a L\right] } . \label{e:gek:dphdl_Mino}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
It is remarkable that Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino}) and (\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino})
are two fully decoupled equations: Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino}) is an ordinary
differential equation for the function $r(\lambda')$, while Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino})
is an ordinary differential equation for the function $\th(\lambda')$. This was
not the case for Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) and (\ref{e:gek:dthdl}) since $\rho^2$ is
a function of both $r$ and $\th$.

Equation~(\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino}) can be integrated by the method of separation
of variables. On a part of $\Li$ where $R(r)\neq 0$, this yields
\be \label{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}
    \lambda' - \lambda'_0 = \eps_r \int_{r_0}^r \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}} ,
\ee
with $r_0 := r(\lambda'_0)$. Note that $\eps_r=\pm 1$ is constant along
the considered part of $\Li$
and could be taken out of the integral because the hypothesis $R(r)\neq 0$
excludes any radial turning point between $\lambda'_0$ and $\lambda'$.

The solution (\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R})
can be extended to include a turning point at one or two of its boundaries,
despite $R(r)=0$ there.
Indeed, let us assume that $r=r_1$ is a radial turning point of $\Li$.
Due to the fact that $R'(r_1)\neq 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_r_turning})], the
integral in the right-hand side of (\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}) with $r=r_1$
converges, since
the taylor expansion $R(\bar{r}) = R'(r_1) (\bar{r} - r_1) + O((\bar{r} - r_1)^2)$
make the integral behave near $r_1$
as\footnote{We assume here $r_0<r_1$, so that the constraint
$R(\bar{r})\geq 0$ on the interval $[r_0,r_1]$ implies $R'(r_1)<0$.}
\[
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{-R'(r_1)}} \int_{r_0}^{r_1} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{r_1 - \bar{r}}} ,
\]
which is a convergent integral.
\begin{remark}
This is the same reasoning as in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:deflect_winding}.
\end{remark}

From the above property, we deduce that the solution of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino})
with $M\geq 1$ radial turning points $r_1,\ldots, r_M$ between $\lambda'_0$ and $\lambda'$
is
\be \label{e:gek:Minotime_r_sum}
    \lambda' - \lambda'_0 = \eps_r^{(0)} \int_{r_0}^{r_1} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
    + \sum_{i=1}^{M-1} \eps_{r}^{(i)}  \int_{r_i}^{r_{i+1}} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
    + \eps_{r}^{(M)} \int_{r_M}^r \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}} .
\ee
where $\eps_r^{(i)}$ is the value of $\eps_r$ between $r_i$ and $r_{i+1}$
for $0\leq i \leq M$,
with the convention $r_{M+1}:=r$. Note that each term is the above sum
is positive, since $\eps_r^{(i)} = -1$ compensates for $r_{i+1} < r_i$.
For instance, if there is a single turning point $r_1$ between
between $\lambda'_0$ and $\lambda'$, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Minotime_r_sum}) gives
\[
   \lambda' - \lambda'_0 = \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle \int_{r_0}^{r_1} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
    + \int_{r}^{r_1} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}} & \mbox{if} \ r_1 > r_0 \\[2ex]
  \displaystyle \int_{r_1}^{r_0} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
    + \int_{r_1}^{r} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}} & \mbox{if} \ r_1 < r_0 ,
    \end{cases}
\]
where all the integrals in the right-hand side are positive.

The right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Minotime_r_sum}) is actually a path
integral and is often abriged by means of a slash notation:
\be
    \lambda' - \lambda'_0 = \dashint_{r_0}^r \frac{\eps_r \, \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}} .
\ee

Similarly, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino}) can be integrated as
\bea
    \lambda' - \lambda'_0  & = & \dashint_{\th_0}^\th \frac{\eps_\th \, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{Q(\bar{\th})}} \nonumber \\
    & = & \eps_\th^{(0)} \int_{\th_0}^{\th_1} \frac{\D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{Q(\bar{\th})}}
        + \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} \eps_{\th}^{(j)}
        \int_{\th_j}^{\th_{j+1}} \frac{\D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{Q(\bar{\th})}}
        + \eps_\th^{(N)}  \int_{\th_N}^{\th} \frac{\D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{Q(\bar{\th})}} ,
\eea
where $\th_0 = \th(\lambda'_0)$, $\th_1,\ldots,\th_N$ are the
latitudinal turning points between $\lambda'_0$ and $\lambda'$
and $\eps_\th^{(j)}$ is the value of $\eps_\th$ between $\th_j$ and $\th_{j+1}$
for $0\leq j \leq N$,
with the convention $\th_{N+1}:=\th$.

%\subsection{Equations of motion in terms of 3+1 Kerr coordinates}

%It is interesting to write the first-order equations of geodesic motion
%in terms of the 3+1 Kerr coordinates $(\ti,r,\th,\tph)$ introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:3p1_Kerr_coord}, since these coordinates are regular on the event
%horizon $\Hor$, contrary to the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$
%considered above.


\begin{hist}
The constant of motion $\mathscr{K}$ has been discovered by Brandon Carter\index{Carter, B.}
in 1968 \cite{Carte68}, in a study about  Kerr-Newman spacetimes\index{Kerr-Newman!spacetime},
which generalize the Kerr ones to nonzero global electric charge.
Carter actually did not get $\mathscr{K}$ from the Killing tensor $\w{K}$,
which was discovered two years later by Martin Walker\index{Walker, M.} and
Roger Penrose\index{Penrose, R.} \cite{WalkeP70}; he
started instead from the Lagrangian (\ref{e:geo:Lagrangian2}) governing
both timelike and null geodesics,
derived the corresponding
Hamiltonian as $H = g^{\mu\nu} p_\mu p_\nu$ (for the uncharged (i.e. Kerr) case)
and discovered that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\index{Hamilton-Jacobi equation}
is separable, i.e.
can be solved by separation of variables, provided one uses the
Kerr coordinates
$(v,r,\th,\tph)$ described in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Kerr_coord}
(NB: Carter's $u$ is our $v$) and not the Boyer-Lindquist ones.
$\mathscr{K}$ appeared then as a separation constant. Carter also introduced
the constant $Q$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Q}). Carter obtained the equivalent
of the first-order system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order}) for the Kerr coordinates. Actually
two of his equations, those for $\D r/\D\lambda$ and $\D\th/\D\lambda$, are
identical to Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) and (\ref{e:gek:dthdl}) of the Boyer-Lindquist
system. This is not surprising since the coordinates
$r$ and $\th$ are the same in both systems. Carter's equations for the
Kerr coordinates $v$ and $\tph$ are slightly more complicated than
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) and (\ref{e:gek:dphdl}) for the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
$t$ and $\ph$. It seems that the Boyer-Lindquist first-order system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order})
has been first derived by Daniel Wilkins\index{Wilkins, D.} in 1972 \cite{Wilki72},
starting from Carter's system and performing the transformation to Boyer-Lindquist
coordinates.

\section{General properties of geodesics}

\subsection{Sign of $E$}

We have:
\begin{greybox}
If the geodesic $\Li$ has some part lying outside the ergoregion $\mathscr{G}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ker:ergoregion}),
then the conserved energy $E$ defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_E}) is necessarily positive:
\be \label{e:gek:E_positive}
    \Li \not\subset \mathscr{G}\quad \Longrightarrow \quad E > 0 .
\ee
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
By the very definition of the ergoregion $\mathscr{G}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ker:ergoregion}),
the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ is timelike outside $\mathscr{G}$. Moreover it is
future-directed there, given the time orientation defined in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Kerr_coord}.
The 4-momentum $\w{p}$ is either timelike or null and always future-directed.
By Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:scalar_caus1}), one has then necessarily $\w{\xi}\cdot\w{p} < 0$; hence
$E := - \w{\xi}\cdot\w{p} > 0$ in $\M\setminus \mathscr{G}$. Since $E$ is constant along $\Li$, it
follows that $E > 0$ everywhere.
\end{proof}
In particular, any timelike or null geodesic that reaches one of the asymptotic regions
$r\to\pm\infty$ has $E>0$.
\begin{remark}
The property (\ref{e:gek:E_positive}) generalizes that obtained for Schwarzschild spacetime [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:E_positive_M_I})] to
the case $a\not=0$, since for Schwarzschild spacetime, the exterior of the ergoregion
is nothing but the exterior of the black hole region.
\end{remark}

Inside the ergoregion, the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ is spacelike and $E$ can be
either positive, zero or negative. Particles for which $E<0$ are called
\defin{negative-energy particles}\index{negative-energy particle}\index{particle!negative-energy --}. They are those involved in the Penrose process discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Penrose_proc}.
Note that according to (\ref{e:gek:E_positive}) a negative-energy particle cannot exist
outside the ergoregion.

\subsection{Winding near the event horizon and the inner horizon}

Let us consider a null or timelike geodesic $\Li$ in the vicinity of the
black hole event horizon $\Hor$.
On $\Hor$, $r=r_+$ and $\Delta = 0$. Then, the term
$\Delta^{-1}$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) makes $\D t/\D\lambda$ diverge as
$r\to r_+$, except in the very special where $(r_+^2 + a^2)E - aL = 0$, which
is equivalent to $E = \Omega_H L$ according to Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_OmegaH}).
Similarly, $\D\ph/\D\lambda$, as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dphdl}), diverges
as $r\to r_+$, except for $E = \Omega_H L$. These two divergences are not
a pathology of $\Li$ per se; they
reflect merely the singularity of Boyer-Lindquist coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ at $\Hor$
(cf.  Sec.~\ref{s:ker:singularities}). However, we read on Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) and
(\ref{e:gek:dphdl}) that the ratio
$\left. \D\ph/\D t \right| _{\Li} := \D\ph/\D\lambda \times (\D t/\D\lambda)^{-1}$
converges to a finite value:
\be \label{e:gek:lim_dphdt_Hor}
    \lim_{r\to r_+} \left. \derd{\ph}{t} \right| _{\Li} = \frac{a}{r_+^2 + a^2} = \Omega_H ,
\ee
where the second equality follows from Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_OmegaH}), letting
the black hole rotation velocity $\Omega_H$ appear.
Hence we conclude that
\begin{greybox}
Any null or timelike geodesic that approaches the event horizon $\Hor$
is winding around it in terms of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates at exactly the black hole rotation velocity $\Omega_H$.
\end{greybox}
If $\Li$ is a timelike geodesic, we have argued in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:circular_orbits}
that $\left. \D\ph/\D t \right| _{\Li}$ can be interpreted as the angular velocity of
$\Li$ as seen by an asymptotic ($r\to +\infty$) inertial observer. The reasoning was
given in the Schwarzschild spacetime context but it actually  involved only
the spacetime symmetry by translation in $t$, so it is applicable here.

\begin{remark}
When $a\not=0$,
a geodesic that starts far from the black hole with
$\left. \D\ph/\D t \right| _{\Li} < 0$ [according to Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dphdl}) with $r\gg m$,
this occurs for $L <0$]
must necessarily have a turning point in $\ph$
if it reaches the event horizon, in order to fulfill (\ref{e:gek:lim_dphdt_Hor}),
where $\Omega_H$ is positive.
This is in sharp contrast with the Schwarzschild case, where $\ph$ was always
a monotonous function of $\lambda$, as shown in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The winding property does not hold for the Kerr or 3+1 Kerr coordinates. Indeed,
we have seen in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:principal_geod} that the
ingoing principal null geodesics $\Li^{\rm in}_{(v,\th,\tph)}$ are geodesics
along which $\tph$ is constant. They are therefore not winding in terms
of neither the Kerr coordinates $(v,r,\th,\tph)$ nor the 3+1 Kerr ones $(\ti,r,\th,\tph)$.
This difference of (coordinate) behaviour is understandable if one considers
the diverging behaviour in $\Delta^{-1}$ of the
relation $\D \tph = \D \ph + a/\Delta\, \D r$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:Kerr_coord_tph})]
between the angular coordinates $\ph$ and $\tph$.
\end{remark}

Similarly, considering the second root $r_-$ of $\Delta$, we deduce
from
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) and
(\ref{e:gek:dphdl}) that
\be
    \lim_{r\to r_-} \left. \derd{\ph}{t} \right| _{\Li} = \frac{a}{r_-^2 + a^2} = \Omega_{\rm in} ,
\ee
where the second equality follows from Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_Omega_in}); it involves
the rotation velocity $\Omega_{\rm in}$ of the inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$.
Hence
\begin{greybox}
Any null or timelike geodesic that approaches the inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$
is winding around it in terms of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates at exactly the
rotation velocity $\Omega_{\rm in}$ of $\Hor_{\rm in}$.
\end{greybox}

\subsection{Asymptotic radial and latitudinal values} \label{s:gek:asymptotic_values}

Let us reconsider the argument in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:Mino_time}
that lead to extend the integral
(\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}) to $r=r_1$, where $r_1$ corresponded to
a radial turning point, i.e. fulfilled $R(r_1)=0$ and $R'(r_1)\neq 0$.
If we assume instead that $R(r_1)=0$, $R'(r_1)=0$ and
$R''(r_1)\neq 0$, i.e. that $r_1$ is a double zero of the polynomial $R$,
the integral in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}) with $r=r_1$ behaves
near $r_1$ as
\[
    \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{R''(r_1)}} \int_{r_0}^{r_1} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{r_1 - \bar{r}} ,
\]
which is a divergent integral. If $r_1$ is a higher order zero of $R$,
the divergence is even worse, being trigered by a higher power of $1/(r_1 - \bar{r})$.
Consequently, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}) with $r=r_1$
implies the Mino time diverges: $\lambda'\to +\infty$. Since $\rho^2 > 0$,
provided that $\rho^2$
does not tend to $0$ (the ring singularity) as $\lambda'\to +\infty$, this
implies that the affine parameter $\lambda$ tends to $+\infty$ as well, given
the relation (\ref{e:gek:def_Mino_time}) between the two parameters.
Hence we conclude
\begin{greybox}
Let $\Li$ be a geodesic of Kerr spacetime and $R(r)$ the associated polynomial
(\ref{e:gek:def_R}).
A point away from the ring singularity $\ring$ and of $r$-coordinate $r_1$
such that both $R(r_1) = 0$ and $R'(r_1) = 0$
can only be reached asymptotically by $\Li$, i.e. in the limit
$\lambda\to \pm\infty$ of the affine parameter
$\lambda$. We call $r_1$ a \defin{radial asymptotic value}\index{radial!asymptotic value}\index{asymptotic!value!radial --} of the geodesic $\Li$.
\end{greybox}
This property explains why $R(r_0) = 0$ and $R'(r_0) \neq 0$ is a necessary condition
to have a radial turning point (cf. Remark~\ref{r:gek:der_r_analytic} on page~\pageref{r:gek:der_r_analytic}).

By exactly the same reasoning, we have
\begin{greybox}
Let $\Li$ be a geodesic of Kerr spacetime and $\Theta(\th)$ the associated function
(\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}).
A point away from the ring singularity $\ring$ and of $\th$-coordinate $\th_1$
such that both $\Theta(\th_1) = 0$ and $\Theta'(\th_1) = 0$
can only be reached asymptotically by $\Li$, i.e. in the limit
$\lambda\to \pm\infty$ of the affine parameter
$\lambda$. We call $\th_1$ a \defin{latitudinal asymptotic value}\index{latitudinal!asymptotic value}\index{asymptotic!value!latitudinal --} of the geodesic $\Li$.
\end{greybox}



\subsection{$\th$-motion} \label{s:gek:th_motion}

Given expression~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}) for $\Theta(\th)$,
the first-order equation of motion (\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino}) can be rewritten as
\be \label{e:gek:th_eff_potential}
    \encadre{ \left( \derd{\th}{\lambda'} \right)^2 + V(\th) = Q },
\ee
with
\be \label{e:gek:def_V_th}
  \encadre{  V(\th) := \cos^2\th \left[ a^2(\mu^2 - E^2) + \frac{L^2}{\sin^2\th} \right] }.
\ee
Note that $V(\th)$ is related to $\Theta(\th)$ by
\be
    \Theta(\th) = Q - V(\th).
\ee
In particular, the latitudinal turning points (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:turning_points})
are characterized by
$V(\th) = Q$ and $V'(\th) \neq 0$, while the latitudinal asymptotic values
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values})
correspond to $V(\th) = Q$ and $V'(\th) = 0$.

We recognize in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_potential}) the first integral of a
(non-relativistic) 1-dimensional motion in the potential $V(\th)$, which we
shall call the
\defin{latitudinal effective potential}\index{latitudinal!effective potential}\index{effective!potential!latitudinal --}. The discussion of the geodesic $\th$-motion
is then based on the properties of that potential, $Q$ playing the role of
the constant ``total energy'' in the right-hand side
of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_potential}). Since $(\D\th / \D\lambda')^2 \geq 0$,
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_potential})  implies
\be \label{e:gek:V_leq_Q}
    V(\th) \leq Q .
\ee
Accordingly, given a plot of $V(\th)$, as in Figs.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0} and
\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}, the allowed range of $\th$ is determined
by the part of the graph of $V(\th)$ that lies below
the horizontal line of ordinate equal to $Q$.

We shall distinguish the
case $L=0$ from $L\not=0$, since the shape of $V(\th)$
is different in these two cases.



\subsubsection{Geodesics with $L=0$}

If $L=0$, the latitudinal effective potential reduces to $V(\th)=a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)\cos^2\th$.
We have then three subcases:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2 E^2 < a^2 \mu^2 \iff a\neq 0 \ \mbox{and}\ |E| < \mu$:
the corresponding graph of $V(\th)$ is shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0} (left part); we deduce immediately from it that
$Q\geq 0$, with
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=0$: the motion is confined to the equatorial
plane $\th=\pi/2$; since it corresponds to a minimum of the effective potential, this
is a stable configuration.
\item $0<Q< a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)$: $\th$ ocillates between
two turning points, which are symmetric about the equatorial plane:
$\th_0 := \arccos\sqrt{Q/(a^2(\mu^2 - E^2))}$
and $\pi-\th_0$.
\item $Q = a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)$: $\th=0$ and $\th=\pi$
are either unstable positions or
latitudinal asymptotic values (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values}), i.e.
the geodesic reaches the rotation axis for $\lambda\to\pm\infty$.
\item $Q > a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)$:
the range of $\th$ is not limited and each time the geodesic reaches the
rotation axis ($\th=0$ or $\th=\pi$),
it crosses it, since the velocity $\D\th / \D\lambda'$
does not vanish there. This leads to $\th < 0$ or $\th > \pi$; to keep $\th$
within the interval $[0,\pi]$, one shall use the identification
of the points $(\th, \ph)$, $(-\th, \ph+\pi)$ and $(\th-\pi, \ph+\pi)$,
which holds on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2 E^2 = a^2\mu^2 \iff a=0\ \mbox{or}\ |E|=\mu$:
$V(\th)=0$ and Eq.(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_potential})
reduces to $(\D\th/\D\lambda')^2 = Q$. This implies $Q\geq 0$, with
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=0$: the geodesic lies at a constant value of $\th$, within the range
$[0,\pi]$.
\item $Q>0$: the solution is $\th(\lambda') = \pm \sqrt{Q}\, \lambda' + \th_0$, which
means that $\th$ varies monotically along the geodesic, crossing the rotation
axis an infinite number of times.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2 E^2 > a^2 \mu^2 \iff a\neq 0 \ \mbox{and}\  |E|>\mu$:
the corresponding graph of $V(\th)$ is shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0} (right part); the Carter constant must obey
$Q \geq - a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2)$, with
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=-a^2(E^2 - \mu^2)$: only $\th=0$ and
$\th=\pi$ are possible and they correspond to minima of $V(\th)$;
the geodesic is then stably located on the rotation axis.
\item $-a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) < Q < 0$: the geodesic oscillates about the rotation
axis, without reaching the equator; one has either $\th\in[0,\th_0]$ or
$\th\in [\pi - \th_0,\pi]$, with the turning point value
$\th_0 := \arccos\sqrt{|Q|/(a^2(E^2 - \mu^2))} < \pi/2$.
\item $Q=0$: $\th=\pi/2$ is either an unstable position or
a latitudinal asymptotic value, i.e. the geodesic approaches the equatorial
plane when $\lambda\to\pm\infty$.
\item $Q>0$: $\th$ varies in all the range $[0,\pi]$; when
the geodesic reaches the rotation axis, it crosses it.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Geodesics with $L\not=0$}

When $L\not=0$, we see from expression~(\ref{e:gek:def_V_th}) that
$V(\th) \to +\infty$ when $\th\to 0$ or $\pi$.
We conclude immediately that the geodesic cannot reach the rotation axis
for $L\not=0$.
Moreover, we have
\[
    \derd{V}{\th} = - 2 \cos\th\sin\th \left[ a^2 (\mu^2 - E^2) + \frac{L^2}{\sin^4\th} \right] .
\]
The extrema of $V$ in $(0,\pi)$ are then given by
\be
    \derd{V}{\th} = 0 \iff
        \th = \frac{\pi}{2} \quad\mbox{or}\quad
        \sin^4\th = \frac{L^2}{a^2(E^2 - \mu^2)} .
\ee
We are thus led to distinguish two cases, depending whether or not the
equation involving $\sin^4\th$ has solutions distinct from $\pi/2$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) \leq L^2 \iff a=0\
\mbox{or}\ |E| \leq \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{L^2}{a^2}}$: the only extremum solution is
$\th=\pi/2$.
Its value is $V(\pi/2)=0$ and it is
necessarily a miminum, since $V(\th) \to +\infty$ at the boundaries of the
interval $[0,\pi]$ (cf. left part of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}).
Hence one must have $Q\geq 0$, with
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=0$: the geodesic stays stably in the
equatorial plane.
\item $Q>0$: the geodesic oscillates about the equatorial plane,
between two turning points at $\th=\th_0$ and $\pi-\th_0$, $\th_0$ being the solution
of $V(\th_0) = Q$ in $(0,\pi/2)$.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) > L^2 \iff a\neq 0\
\mbox{and}\ |E| > \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{L^2}{a^2}}$: $V(\th)$ has three extrema (cf. right part of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}), which are located at
$\th=\th_*$, $\pi/2$ and $\pi-\th_*$ with
\be
    \th_* := \arcsin\sqrt{\frac{|L|}{a\sqrt{E^2 - \mu^2}}}
    \quad\mbox{and}\quad 0 < \th_* < \frac{\pi}{2} .
\ee
$\th_*$ and $\pi-\th_*$ correspond to the minimum of $V(\th)$,
while $\pi/2$ corresponds to a local maximum. The minimum is
$V(\th_*) = (1-\sin^2\th_*)(a^2(\mu^2-E^2) + L^2/\sin^2\th_*) = - (a \sqrt{E^2 - \mu^2} - |L|)^2$.
This is necessary the minimal value of $Q$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:V_leq_Q})]:
\be
    Q_{\rm min} = - \left( a \sqrt{E^2 - \mu^2} - |L| \right) ^2 .
\ee
We have then (cf. right part of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0})
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q = Q_{\rm min}$: the geodesic stays stably at a fixed value of $\th$,
either $\th_*$ or $\pi - \th_*$.
\item $Q_{\rm min} < Q < 0$: the geodesic oscillates between two turning
points either in the Northen
hemisphere ($\th < \pi/2$) or the Southern one ($\th > \pi/2$), without reaching
the equator nor the rotation axis.
\item $Q=0$: the geodesic lies unstably in the equatorial plane or
moves asymptotically towards it (possibly after a turning point at $\th_0\neq\pi/2$ such that
$V(\th_0)=0$), $\pi/2$ being a latitudinal asymptotic value, since $\Theta'(\pi/2) = - V'(\pi/2)=0$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values}).
\item $Q>0$: the geodesic oscillates about the equatorial plane,
between two turning points at $\th=\th_0$ and $\pi-\th_0$, $\th_0$ being the solution
of $V(\th_0) = Q$ in $(0,\pi/2)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We can summarize the above results by
\begin{greybox}
\begin{itemize}
\item A geodesic $\Li$ of Kerr spacetime cannot encounter the rotation axis unless it has $L=0$.
\item If $a=0$ (Schwarzschild limit) or $|E| \leq \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{L^2}{a^2}}$,
the Carter constant $Q$ is necessarily non-negative:
\be
    Q \geq 0 .
\ee
\item The Carter constant $Q$ can take negative values if, and only if,
$a\neq 0$ and $|E| > \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{L^2}{a^2}}$; its range is then
limited from below:
\be
    Q \geq Q_{\rm min} = - \left( a \sqrt{E^2 - \mu^2} - |L| \right) ^2.
\ee
\item If $Q>0$, $\Li$ oscillates symmetrically about the equatorial plane,
between two turning points, $\th_0$ and $\pi-\th_0$, such that $0<\th_0<\pi/2$,
except for two subcases with $L=0$: (i) $Q = a^2 (\mu^2 - E^2)$: $\Li$
lies unstably along the rotation axis or approaches it asymptotically
and (ii) $Q >a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)$: $\Li$
crosses repeatedly the rotation axis, with $\th$ taking all values in the
range $[0,\pi]$.
\item If $Q=0$, $\Li$ is stably confined to the equatorial plane
for $a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2) < L^2$ or $a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2) = L^2 \neq 0$;
for $a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2) > L^2$, $\Li$ either lies unstably in the equatorial
plane or approaches it asymptotically from one side, while for $L=0$ and ($a=0$ or $|E|=\mu$),
$\Li$ lies at a constant value $\th=\th_0\in[0,\pi]$.
\item If $Q_{\rm min} < Q < 0$, $\Li$ oscillates between two turning
points strictly located in the Northern hemisphere ($0<\th<\pi/2$) or in
the Southern hemisphere ($\pi/2<\th<\pi$) for $L\neq 0$, while for $L=0$,
$\Li$ oscillates about the rotation axis, without encoutering the equatorial
plane, having a turning point at $\th_0$ such that $0<\th_0<\pi/2$
(motion in the Northern hemisphere) or $\pi/2<\th_0<\pi$
(motion in the Southern hemisphere).
\item If $Q = Q_{\rm min}$, $\Li$ lies stably at a constant value $\th=\th_0$,
with $\th_0 = 0$ or $\pi$ (the rotation axis) for $L=0$ and $0<\th_0<\pi$
for $L\neq 0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{greybox}

\begin{remark}
We could have deduced that $L=0$ is a necessary condition for a geodesic
to encounter the rotation axis without studying the potential $V(\th)$. Indeed,
by definition, $L = \w{\eta}\cdot\w{p}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_L})], with the Killing
vector $\w{\eta}$ being zero on the rotation axis, since the latter is
pointwise invariant under the action of the rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$.
Hence $L=0$ on the rotation axis. Since $L$ is constant along the geodesic,
the result follows immediately.
