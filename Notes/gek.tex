\section{Equations of geodesic motion}

\subsection{Introduction} \label{s:gek:geod_motion_intro}

In all this chapter, we are concerned with the motion of a particle
$\mathscr{P}$ in the Kerr spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$, under the hypothesis that $\mathscr{P}$
feels only gravity, as described by $\w{g}$ (freely falling particle).
The worldline $\Li$ of $\mathscr{P}$
is then necessarily a geodesic\footnote{The definition and basic properties of geodesics
are recalled in Appendix~\ref{s:geo}; see also Sec.~\ref{s:fra:geod_motion}.} of
$(\M,\w{g})$. It is a timelike geodesic if $\mathscr{P}$ is a massive particle
and a null geodesic if $\mathscr{P}$ is massless (e.g. a photon).

In a given coordinate system $(x^\alpha)$, the geodesic $\Li$ is described
by a system of the form\footnote{In Appendices~\ref{s:bas} and \ref{s:geo},
a different symbol is used for the function $X^\alpha(\lambda)$ defining
$\Li$ and the coordinate $x^\alpha$ (cf. Secs.~\ref{s:bas:vectors} and
\ref{s:geo:geodesic_eq}). Following standard usage in the physics literature,
we shall not do this in this chapter.}
$x^\alpha = x^\alpha(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is an
affine parameter\footnote{See Sec.~\ref{s:geo:def} for the definition
of an affine parameter along a geodesic.} along $\Li$. We choose $\lambda$ to be the affine parameter
associated with $\mathscr{P}$'s 4-momentum $\w{p}$,
i.e. such that $\D x^\alpha / \D\lambda = p^\alpha$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:p_dxdl})].
In particular, this implies that $\lambda$ is increasing towards the future\footnote{Let us recall that the Kerr spacetime is time-oriented, cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ker:time_orientation}.} along $\Li$.
The curve $\Li$ is a geodesic iff the functions $x^\alpha(\lambda)$ obey
the geodesic equation [Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:eq_geod}) in Appendix~\ref{s:geo}]:
\be \label{e:gek:eq_geod}
    \frac{\D^2 x^\alpha}{\D\lambda^2} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu}
    \frac{\D x^\mu}{\D\lambda} \frac{\D x^\nu}{\D\lambda} = 0 ,\qquad 0 \leq \alpha \leq 3,
\ee
where the $\Gamma^\alpha_{\ \, \mu \nu}$'s are the Christoffel symbols\index{Christoffel symbols} of the metric $\w{g}$
with respect to the coordinates $(x^\alpha)$, as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:bas:Christoffel}).
Equation~(\ref{e:gek:eq_geod}) is a system of four coupled second-order
differential equations, which are non-linear. We are going to see that in
order to compute the geodesics of Kerr spacetime, it is not necessary to
solve this system, since, as in the Schwarzschild case studied in Chap.~\ref{s:ges}, there exists
enough first integrals of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:eq_geod}) to reduce
the problem to four first-order equations
of the type $\D x^\alpha/\D\lambda = F^\alpha(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$.

Three integrals of motion are similar to those of Schwarzschild geodesics.
One is the particle's mass $\mu$ (Sec.~\ref{s:gek:mass_int_motion} below)
and the two other ones are
the conserved energy $E$ and the conserved angular momentum
$L$ (Sec.~\ref{s:gek:int_motion_sym}), which arise from the common symmetries
of Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes: stationarity (outside the ergosphere) and axisymmetry.
In the Schwarzschild case, the fourth integral of motion was provided by
spherical symmetry, which constrained all geodesics to be planar, so that
a suitable choice of
coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ makes a given geodesic confined to the
hyperplane $\th=\pi/2$, yielding the first integral $p^\th=0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:pth_zero})].
The Kerr spacetime with $a\not=0$ being not spherically symmetric, we loose
this property here. Fortunaly there exists another
integral of motion, known as the \emph{Carter constant}; it arises from a remarkable property
of Kerr spacetime: the existence of a non-trivial Killing tensor (Sec.~\ref{s:gek:Carter_const}).
This makes a total of four integral of motions,
which renders the problem integrable (Secs.~\ref{s:gek:first_order_system} to
\ref{e:gek:integration}).


\subsection{Integrals of motion from spacetime symmetries} \label{s:gek:int_motion_sym}

As for Schwarzschild spacetime (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ges:fiom}), we have the following
property.
\begin{greybox}
The Killing vectors $\w{\xi}$ and $\w{\eta}$ of Kerr spacetime,
associated respectively with
stationarity and axisymmetry [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_xi_eta})],
give birth to two conserved quantities
along any geodesic $\Li$:
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:def_E_L}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{E := - \w{\xi}\cdot \w{p} = - \w{g}(\w{\xi},\w{p}) } \label{e:gek:def_E} \\
& \encadre{L := \w{\eta}\cdot \w{p} = \w{g}(\w{\eta},\w{p}) } , \label{e:gek:def_L}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\w{p}$ is the 4-momentum of the particle $\mathscr{P}$, the worldline of which is $\Li$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:fra:worldlines}).
For the same reasons as in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:fiom}, $E$ is called
the \defin{conserved energy}\index{conserved!energy}\index{energy!conserved --}
or \defin{energy at infinity}\index{energy!at infinity} of $\mathscr{P}$,
while $L$ is called $\mathscr{P}$'s \defin{conserved angular momentum}\index{conserved!angular momentum}\index{angular momentum!conserved --}
or \defin{angular momentum at infinity}\index{angular momentum!at infinity}
of $\mathscr{P}$.
\end{greybox}
\begin{remark}
Asymptotically, the scalar $L$ is the
component along the rotation axis of $\mathscr{P}$'s (total) angular momentum vector $\w{L}_{\rm tot}$
as measured by an inertial observer at rest with respect to the black hole.
For this reason, it is sometimes denoted by $L_z$, instead of merely $L$.
\end{remark}

In coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ adapted to spacetime symmetries,
i.e. coordinates such that $\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$ and $\w{\eta}=\wpar_\ph$,
for instance Boyer-Lindquist coordinates (Sec.~\ref{s:ker:expr_BL}),
Kerr coordinates (Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Kerr_coord}) or 3+1 Kerr coordinates
(Sec.~\ref{s:ker:3p1_Kerr_coord}), one can rewrite
(\ref{e:gek:def_E_L})
in terms of the components $p_t = g_{t\mu} \, p^\mu$ and $p_\ph = g_{\ph\mu} \, p^\mu$
of the 1-form $\uu{p}$ associated to $\w{p}$ by metric duality:
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:E_pt_L_pph}
\begin{align}
& E = - p_t \\
& L = p_\ph
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Indeed, in such a coordinate system, $\xi^\mu =  \delta^\mu_{\ \, t}$
and $\eta^\mu = \delta^\mu_{\ \, \ph}$, so that $E = -g_{\mu\nu} \, \xi^\mu p^\nu = -g_{t\nu} \, p^\nu = -p_t$
and $L = g_{\mu\nu} \, \eta^\mu p^\nu = g_{\ph\nu} \, p^\nu = p_\ph$.

\begin{example}[Generators of the event and inner horizons] \label{x:gek:null_generator_hor}
Let us choose for $\Li$ a null geodesic generator of the event horizon $\Hor$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:null_gen_hor}). $\Li$ is then an outgoing principal null
geodesic and the 4-momentum vector $\w{p}$ is proportional to the null vector
$\wl \equalH \w{\chi} = \w{\xi} + \Omega_H \w{\eta}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:l_eqH_chi})
and (\ref{e:ker:def_chi})].
By definition of a
generator of a null hypersurface (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:def:null_geod_gen}),
$\w{p}$ is normal to $\Hor$. Since the Killing vector fields $\w{\xi}$ and $\w{\eta}$
are tangent to $\Hor$ (for $\Hor$ is globally preserved by the
spacetime symmetries), we get immediately from
the definitions (\ref{e:gek:def_E_L}) $E=0$ and $L=0$.
Similarly, if $\Li$ is a null geodesic generator of the
inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$, $\Li$ is an outgoing principal null
geodesic, with $\w{p}$ proportional to
the null normal
$\wl \stackrel{\Hor_{\rm in}}{=} \w{\chi}_{\rm in} = \w{\xi} + \Omega_{\rm in} \w{\eta}$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:chi_in_ell}) and (\ref{e:ker:def_chi_in})], so that we
have $E=0$ and $L=0$ as well. Hence we conclude:
\be \label{e:gek:generator_hor_E_L_zero}
    \Li \ \mbox{null geodesic generator of}\ \Hor\ \mbox{or}\ \Hor_{\rm in}
   \  \Longrightarrow\  E = 0 \quad\mbox{and}\quad L = 0 .
\ee
\end{example}

In what follows, we are going to use Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
$(x^\alpha)=(t,r,\th,\ph)$
as introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:expr_BL}.
Given the components (\ref{e:ker:metric_BL}) of the metric tensor $\w{g}$
in these coordinates, evaluating $E$ and $L$
via $E = - g_{t\mu} \, p^\mu$ and $L = g_{\ph\mu} \, p^\mu$ yields
\be \label{e:gek:E_first_int}
    E = \left( 1 - \frac{2 m r}{\rho^2} \right)\,  p^t
        + \frac{2 a m r \sin^2\th}{\rho^2}\,  p^\ph  .
\ee
\be \label{e:gek:L_first_int}
    L = - \frac{2 a m r \sin^2\th}{\rho^2} \, p^t
        + \left( r^2 + a^2 + \frac{2 a^2 m r \sin^2\th}{\rho^2} \right)
    \sin^2\th \,  p^\ph ,
\ee
where $\rho^2 := r^2 + a^2 \cos^2\th$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_rho2})].

Let us recall that the components $(p^\alpha)$ of the 4-momentum are
related to the equation $x^\alpha = x^\alpha(\lambda)$ of the geodesic $\Li$
in terms of the affine parameter $\lambda$ by $p^\alpha = \D x^\alpha / \D\lambda$
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:p_dxdl})], i.e.
\be \label{e:gek:pa_der_xa}
    p^t = \derd{t}{\lambda},\quad
    p^r = \derd{r}{\lambda},\quad
    p^\th = \derd{\th}{\lambda},\quad
    p^\ph = \derd{\ph}{\lambda} .
\ee

\subsection{Mass as an integral of motion} \label{s:gek:mass_int_motion}

The mass $\mu$ of particle $\mathscr{P}$ is related to the scalar square of
the 4-momentum vector $\w{p}$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:def_mass}):
\be \label{e:gek:mu_gpp}
    \mu^2 = - \w{g}(\w{p}, \w{p}) .
\ee
The fact that $\Li$ is a geodesic implies that $\mu$ is constant along
$\Li$ (cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:vv_const}) in Appendix~\ref{s:geo}). It therefore
provides a third integral of motion, after $E$ and $L$.

It is convenient to express (\ref{e:gek:mu_gpp}) in terms of the inverse metric
in order to let appear $p_t = -E$ and $p_\ph = L$:
\[
    \mu^2 = - g^{\mu\nu} p_\mu p_\nu .
\]

Given the components (\ref{e:ker:inv_met_BL}) of the inverse metric
in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we get
\bea
    \mu^2 & = & \frac{1}{\Delta}
    \left( r^2 + a^2 + \frac{2 a^2 m r \sin^2\th}{\rho^2} \right) E^2
    -\frac{4 a m r}{\rho^2 \Delta} E L
    - \frac{1}{\Delta}\left(1 - \frac{2 m r}{\rho^2} \right) \frac{L^2}{\sin^2\th}
    \nonumber \\
   &  & - \frac{\rho^2}{\Delta} \left( p^r \right) ^2
    - \rho^2 \left( p^\theta \right) ^2 ,   \label{e:gek:mu2_first_int}
\eea
where $\Delta := r^2 - 2 m r + a^2$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_Delta})].
Note that we have expressed $p_r$ and $p_\th$ in terms of $p^r$ and $p^\th$
thanks to the relations $p_r = g_{r\mu} p^\mu$ and $p_\th = g_{\th\mu} p^\mu$,
which are very simple for the Boyer-Lindquist components (\ref{e:ker:metric_BL})
of $\w{g}$:
\be \label{e:gek:p_r_p_th_cov_con}
    p_r = \frac{\rho^2}{\Delta} \, p^r
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    p_\th = \rho^2 \, p^\th .
\ee

\subsection{The fourth integral of motion: Carter constant} \label{s:gek:Carter_const}

It turns out that the Kerr spacetime is endowed with a non-trivial
Killing tensor of valence 2: the
\defin{Walker-Penrose Killing tensor}\index{Killing!tensor!Walker-Penrose --}\index{Walker-Penrose Killing tensor} $\w{K}$, which is the symmetric tensor of type
$(0,2)$ defined by
\be \label{e:gek:def_K}
    \encadre{ \w{K} := (r^2 + a^2) \left( \uu{k} \otimes \uu{\el} + \uu{\el} \otimes \uu{k} \right) + r^2 \w{g} } ,
\ee
where $\uu{\el}$ and $\uu{k}$ are the 1-forms associated by metric duality
to the null vector fields $\w{k}$ and $\wl$ tangent to the principal null
geodesics introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:principal_geod}. In index notation,
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_K}) writes
\be
    K_{\alpha\beta} = (r^2 + a^2) \left(k_\alpha \el_\beta + \el_\alpha k_\beta \right)
        + r^2 g_{\alpha\beta} .
\ee
$\w{K}$ is called a \defin{Killing tensor}\index{Killing!tensor} because its symmetrized covariant derivative vanishes identically:
\be \label{e:gek:Killing_eq_K}
    \encadre{ \nabla_{(\alpha} K_{\beta\gamma)} = 0 }.
\ee
This property can be seen as a generalization of the Killing equation
(\ref{e:neh:Killing_equation}) to tensors of valence 2.
That the tensor $\w{K}$ defined by (\ref{e:gek:def_K}) obeys the Killing
identity (\ref{e:gek:Killing_eq_K}) is shown in the notebook~\ref{s:sam:Kerr_Killing_tensor}.

Killing tensors are discussed in Sec.~\ref{e:geo:Killing_tensor} of Appendix~\ref{s:geo}.
It is shown there that the Killing identity (\ref{e:gek:Killing_eq_K}) implies that
the following quantity is constant along any geodesic $\Li$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:geo:Kvv_const})]:
\be
    \encadre{ \mathscr{K} := \w{K}(\w{p}, \w{p}) = K_{\mu\nu} p^\mu p^\nu } .
\ee
$\mathscr{K}$ is named \defin{Carter constant}\index{Carter!constant}.
From the definition (\ref{e:gek:def_K}) of $\w{K}$, we have
\be \label{e:gek:Kcarter_prov}
    \mathscr{K} = 2(r^2 + a^2) \langle \uu{k}, \w{p} \rangle
        \langle \uu{\el}, \w{p} \rangle + r^2 \w{g}(\w{p}, \w{p}).
\ee
Now by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:mu_gpp}), $\w{g}(\w{p}, \w{p}) = - \mu^2$. Besides, we
have
\[
  \langle \uu{k}, \w{p} \rangle = k_\mu p^\mu = k^\mu p_\mu .
\]
The last form allows us to let appear the constants of motion $p_t = -E$ and
$p_\ph = L$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:E_pt_L_pph})]. Using it with the components
of $\w{k}$ as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:k_BL}), we get
\[
    \langle \uu{k}, \w{p} \rangle = - \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} E
    - p_r + \frac{a}{\Delta} L .
\]
Similarly, from the components (\ref{e:ker:ell_BL}) of $\wl$, we obtain
\[
     \langle \uu{\el}, \w{p} \rangle = - \frac{1}{2} E + \frac{\Delta}{2(r^2 + a^2)} p_r
     + \frac{a}{2(r^2 + a^2)} L .
\]
Accordingly, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_prov}) becomes
\[
    \mathscr{K} = \frac{1}{\Delta} \left[ (r^2 + a^2) E + \Delta p_r - a L \right]
      \left[ (r^2 + a^2) E - \Delta p_r - a L \right] - r^2 \mu^2 ,
\]
which can be rewritten as
\be \label{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int}
   \encadre{ \mathscr{K} = \frac{1}{\Delta} \left[ \left( (r^2 + a^2) E - a L \right)^2
        - \rho^4 (p^r)^2 \right] - r^2 \mu^2 }.
\ee
Note that we have expressed $p_r$ in terms of $p^r$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:p_r_p_th_cov_con}).

We can get some physical interpretation of the Carter constant from the above
expression, in the case where the particle $\mathscr{P}$ following the
geodesic $\Li$ visits the asymptotic region $r\to+\infty$. Indeed, given
that $\Delta := r^2 - 2m r + a^2 \sim r^2$  and $\rho^4 := (r^2 + a^2\cos^2\th)^2 \sim r^4$
as $r\to+\infty$, we deduce from Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int})
that
\be \label{e:gek:Kcarter_r_inf}
    \mathscr{K} \underset{r\to + \infty}{\sim} r^2 \left[ E^2 - \mu^2 - (p^r)^2 \right] .
\ee
Then let $\Obs$ be the asymptotic inertial observer at rest with respect to the
black hole, i.e. the observer with $r\gg m$ and whose 4-velocity
coincides with the Killing vector
$\w{\xi} = \wpar_t$. $E$ is then $\mathscr{P}$'s energy as measured by $\Obs$
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:E_obs}) and (\ref{e:gek:def_E})], so that, according to
Einstein's formula (\ref{e:fra:E2_m2_P2}), $E^2 - \mu^2 = \w{P}\cdot\w{P}$, where
$\w{P}$ is $\mathscr{P}$'s linear momentum as measured by $\Obs$. Given
that asymptotically, $p^r\sim P^r$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:p_E_P})],
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_r_inf}) becomes
\[
    \mathscr{K} \underset{r\to + \infty}{\sim} r^2 \left[ \w{P}\cdot\w{P} - (P^r)^2 \right]
    = r^2 \left[ (P^{(\th)})^2 + (P^{(\ph)})^2 \right],
\]
where $P^{(\th)} = r P^\th \sim r p^\th$ and $P^{(\ph)} = r\sin\th\, P^\ph \sim r\sin\th\, p^\ph$
are the angular components of $\w{P}$ in the
orthonormal basis $(\w{e}_{(r)}, \w{e}_{(\th)}, \w{e}_{(\ph)}) := (\wpar_r, r^{-1} \wpar_\th,
(r\sin\th)^{-1}\wpar_\ph)$.
Now the total angular momentum of $\mathscr{P}$ measured by $\Obs$ is
\[
    \w{L}_{\rm tot} = \w{r} \times \w{P} = - r P^{(\ph)} \w{e}_{(\th)}
        + r P^{(\th)} \w{e}_{(\ph)} .
\]
Hence we may conclude that asymptotically, the Carter constant coincides with
the square of $\mathscr{P}$'s angular momentum as measured by the inertial observer $\Obs$:
\be \label{e:gek:Kcarter_asymptot}
    \mathscr{K} \underset{r\to + \infty}{\sim} \w{L}_{\rm tot} \cdot \w{L}_{\rm tot} .
\ee

We shall see later that one has always $\mathscr{K}\geq 0$. For now, let us
establish the following characterization of null geodesics with $\mathscr{K} = 0$:
\begin{greybox}
A null geodesic $\Li$ has a vanishing Carter constant $\mathscr{K}$ if, and
only if, $\Li$ is a principal null geodesic:
\be \label{e:gek:K_zero_null}
   \mathscr{K} = 0 \iff \Li = \Li^{\rm in}_{(v,\th,\tph)} \quad\mbox{or}\quad
        \Li = \Li^{\rm out}_{(u,\th,\tilde{\tph})} ,
\ee
where $\Li^{\rm in}_{(v,\th,\tph)}$ (resp. $\Li^{\rm out}_{(u,\th,\tilde{\tph})}$)
stands for one of the ingoing (resp. outgoing) principal null geodesic
introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:principal_geod}.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
Consider expression (\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_prov}) for $\mathscr{K}$. If $\Li$
is a null geodesic, the term $\w{g}(\w{p},\w{p})$ vanishes identically, so that
one is left with
\[
    \mathscr{K} = 2 (r^2 + a^2) (\w{k}\cdot\w{p}) (\wl\cdot\w{p}) .
\]
Given that $r^2 + a^2\neq 0$ (this is clear for $a\neq 0$, while if $a=0$
(Schwarzschild case),
$r=0$ is excluded from the spacetime manifold), we have then
\[
     \mathscr{K} = 0 \iff \w{k}\cdot\w{p} = 0 \quad\mbox{or}\quad \wl\cdot\w{p} = 0 .
\]
The vectors $\w{k}$, $\wl$ and $\w{p}$ are all null.
Now, according to the Corollary~2 in Sec.~\ref{s:fra:time_orientation},
two null vectors are orthogonal iff they are colinear. Hence
\[
    \mathscr{K} = 0 \iff \w{p} = \alpha \w{k} \quad\mbox{or}\quad \w{p} = \alpha \wl.
\]
Since $\w{k}$ (resp. $\wl$) is tangent to $\Li^{\rm in}_{(v,\th,\tph)}$ (resp.
$\Li^{\rm out}_{(u,\th,\tilde{\tph})}$), this completes the proof.
\end{proof}
Note that the result (\ref{e:gek:K_zero_null}) is consistent with the
interpretation (\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_asymptot}) of $\mathscr{K}$, since asymptotically
the principal null geodesics are purely radial\footnote{Indeed,
we deduce from Eqs.~(\ref{e:ker:k_BL}) and (\ref{e:ker:ell_BL}) that, for $r\to+\infty$,
$\w{k} \sim \wpar_t - \wpar_r$ and $\wl \sim (\wpar_t + \wpar_r)/2$.},
and hence have $\w{L}_{\rm tot} = 0$.

\begin{example}[Generators of the event and inner horizons]
We have seen in Example~\ref{x:gek:null_generator_hor} in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:int_motion_sym}
that the null geodesic generators of the event horizon $\Hor$ and the
inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$ have $E=0$ and $L=0$.
Since these generators are principal null geodesics (cf.
Secs.~\ref{s:gek:null_gen_hor} and \ref{s:ker:Cauchy_hor}), the above results shows
that in addition $\mathscr{K}=0$. As $\mu=0$ by definition of a null geodesic,
we see that the four integrals of motion $\mu$, $E$, $L$ and $\mathscr{K}$ all
vanish for these geodesics.
\end{example}
The converse is true:
\begin{greybox}
The null geodesic generators of the event horizon $\Hor$ and of the
inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$ are the only geodesics of Kerr spacetime
having their four integrals of motion vanishing:
\be \label{e:gek:all_const_zero}
\Li \ \mbox{null geodesic generator of}\ \Hor\ \mbox{or}\ \Hor_{\rm in} \iff
(\mu, E, L, \mathscr{K}) = (0, 0, 0, 0) .
\ee
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
If a geodesic $\Li$ has $(\mu,\mathscr{K}) = (0,0)$,
$\Li$ is necessary null and (\ref{e:gek:K_zero_null}) shows that
$\Li$ is a principal null geodesic. Moreover
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int}) with $(\mu, E, L, \mathscr{K}) = (0, 0, 0, 0)$
implies $p^r = 0$ (i.e. $\Li$ lies at a constant value of $r$).
If $\Li$ is ingoing, then $\w{p} \propto \w{k}$, with the Boyer-Lindquist components
of $\w{k}$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:k_BL}). Since $k^r = -1$, this precludes
$p^r = 0$. Hence $\Li$ is an outgoing principal null geodesic
and one has $\w{p} \propto \wl$, with the Boyer-Lindquist components
of $\wl$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:ell_BL}). We read $\ell^r = \Delta / (2(r^2+a^2))$
with $\Delta\neq 0$, except precisely on $\Hor$ and
$\Hor_{\rm in}$\footnote{This is graphically confirmed by
Figs.~\ref{f:ker:princ_null_geod_a90} and
\ref{f:ker:princ_null_geod_a50}, which show that $\Hor$ and $\Hor_{\rm in}$ are the only
locations where a principal null geodesic can have $r=\mathrm{const}$.}. Hence
$p^r = 0$ is possible only on $\Hor$ and $\Hor_{\rm in}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{First order equations of motion} \label{s:gek:first_order_system}

We have thus four first integrals of the geodesic equation
(\ref{e:gek:eq_geod}) at disposal:
$E$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:E_first_int})], $L$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:L_first_int})],
$\mu^2$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:mu2_first_int})] and $\mathscr{K}$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int})]. In the expressions of each of these integrals,
$p^\alpha$ has to be thought of as the first order derivative $\D x^\alpha/\D\lambda$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:pa_der_xa})].
Two first integrals, namely $E$ and $L$, are linear in the $p^\alpha$'s, while
the two others, namely $\mu^2$ and $\mathscr{K}$, are quadratic.
Furthermore, Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:E_first_int}) and (\ref{e:gek:L_first_int})
constitute a decoupled subsystem for $(p^t, p^\ph)$, which can easily be solved\footnote{An
intermediate step is combining  Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:E_first_int}) and (\ref{e:gek:L_first_int})
to get $a E - L /\sin^2\th = a p^t - (r^2 + a^2) p^\ph$
and $(r^2 + a^2) E - a L = \Delta(p^t - a\sin^2\th p^\ph)$.},
yielding
\be \label{e:gek:rho2_pt}
    \rho^2 p^t = \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} [(r^2 + a^2) E - a L] + a ( L - a E \sin^2\th )
\ee
\be  \label{e:gek:rho2_pph}
    \rho^2 p^\ph = \frac{L}{\sin^2\th} - a E
    + \frac{a}{\Delta}\left[(r^2 + a^2) E - a L\right] .
\ee
Besides, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_first_int}) involves only $p^r$ and can
be recast as
\be \label{e:gek:p_r_R}
    \rho^4 (p^r)^2 = R(r)  ,
\ee
with
\be \label{e:gek:def_R}
   \encadre{ R(r) := \left[ (r^2 + a^2) E - a L \right]^ 2 - \Delta (r^2 \mu^2 + \mathscr{K}) }.
\ee
In the above expression, let us recall that $\Delta$ is the function of $r$
given by Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_Delta}): $\Delta := r^2 - 2 m r + a^2$. All other
quantities are constant. Accordingly, $R(r)$ is a 4th order polynomial of $r$.
Equation~(\ref{e:gek:p_r_R}) implies that, along the geodesic $\Li$, it has to fulfill
\be \label{e:gek:R_non_neg}
    \encadre{R(r) \geq 0 } .
\ee

Finally, if we substitute $p^r$ by the value given by Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:p_r_R})-(\ref{e:gek:def_R}) in the mass first integral (\ref{e:gek:mu2_first_int}), we get, after simplification,
\be \label{e:gek:p_th_Th}
    \rho^4 (p^\th)^2 = \Theta(\th) ,
\ee
with
\be \label{e:gek:def_Theta}
   \encadre{ \Theta(\th) := \mathscr{K} - \left(\frac{L}{\sin\th} - a E \sin\th \right)^2
        - \mu^2 a^2 \cos^2\th } .
\ee
Equation.~(\ref{e:gek:p_th_Th}) imposes that $\Theta(\th)$ is non-negative along
the geodesic $\Li$:
\be \label{e:gek:Theta_non_neg}
    \encadre{\Theta(\th) \geq 0 } .
\ee

The following constant is often used instead of $\mathscr{K}$:
\be \label{e:gek:def_Q}
    \encadre{Q := \mathscr{K} - (L - a E)^2 }
\ee
Thanks to it, we may rewrite (\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}) as
\be \label{e:gek:Theta_Q}
    \encadre{ \Theta(\th) = Q + \cos^2\th \left[ a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2)
    - \frac{L^2}{\sin^2\th} \right] } .
\ee
Following the standard usage, we call $Q$ the \defin{Carter constant}\index{Carter!constant}
as well. To distinguish between the two Carter constants, we shall specify \emph{Carter constant $Q$}
or \emph{Carter constant $\mathscr{K}$}. As we shall see in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:th_motion},
$Q$ is well adapted to the description of the $\th$-motion of geodesics. On the other
hand, a nice property of $\mathscr{K}$, which is not shared by $Q$, is to be always non-negative,
as Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}) and (\ref{e:gek:Theta_non_neg}) show:
\be
  \encadre{  \mathscr{K} \geq 0 }.
\ee

If the particle $\mathscr{P}$ reaches the asymptotic region $r\gg m$, we deduce from
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Q}) and (\ref{e:gek:Kcarter_asymptot}) the following behaviour of $Q$:
\be \label{e:gek:Q_Ltot2_L2}
   Q \underset{r\to + \infty}{\sim} \w{L}_{\rm tot} \cdot \w{L}_{\rm tot}
    - L^2 + a (2 L - a E^2) .
\ee
Hence, if $a=0$, $Q$ can be interpreted as the square of
the part of $\mathscr{P}$'s angular momentum (measured by the asymptotic inertial
observer) that is not in $L$.

\begin{remark}
As for $\mathscr{K}$,
one may derive the Carter constant $Q$ from a Killing tensor.
Indeed, from the Walker-Penrose Killing tensor $\w{K}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_K})], let us form
the tensor field
\be \label{e:gek:def_tilde_K}
    \w{\tilde{K}} := \w{K} - \uu{\tilde{\eta}}\otimes\uu{\tilde{\eta}} ,
\ee
where
\be
    \w{\tilde{\eta}} := \w{\eta} + a \w{\xi} .
\ee
Being a linear combination with constant coefficients of the Killing vectors
$\w{\eta}$ and $\w{\xi}$, $\w{\tilde{\eta}}$ is itself a Killing vector.
It follows that $\uu{\tilde{\eta}}\otimes\uu{\tilde{\eta}}$ is a Killing tensor
(cf. Example~\ref{x:geo:trivial_Killing_tensors} in Sec.~\ref{e:geo:Killing_tensor}),
so that $\w{\tilde{K}}$ a Killing tensor. Applying it to the
4-momentum $\w{p}$, we get
\[
    \w{\tilde{K}}(\w{p},\w{p}) =  \underbrace{\w{K}(\w{p},\w{p})}_{\mathscr{K}}
        - (\underbrace{\langle\uu{\eta},\w{p}\rangle}_{L}
        + a \underbrace{\langle\uu{\xi},\w{p}\rangle}_{-E})^2 .
\]
Comparing with the definition (\ref{e:gek:def_Q}), we conclude that
\be
    Q = \w{\tilde{K}}(\w{p},\w{p}) .
\ee
As a side remark, we note that
the Boyer-Lindquist components of the contravariant tensor associated to $\w{\tilde{K}}$ by
metric duality have an expression particularly simple in terms of those of
the inverse metric (cf. the notebook~\ref{s:sam:Kerr_Killing_tensor}):
\be
    \tilde{K}^{\alpha\beta} = - a^2 \cos^2 \theta \, g^{\alpha\beta}
    + \operatorname{diag}(-a^2\cos^2\theta, 0, 1, \tan^{-2}\theta)^{\alpha\beta} .
\ee
\end{remark}

In view of the relation (\ref{e:gek:pa_der_xa}) between the $p^\alpha$'s
and the derivatives of the functions $x^\alpha(\lambda)$, we may
collect Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:rho2_pt}), (\ref{e:gek:rho2_pph}), (\ref{e:gek:p_r_R})
and (\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}) as the first-order system
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:eom_first_order}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{ \rho^2 \derd{t}{\lambda} = \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} [(r^2 + a^2) E - a L] + a ( L - a E \sin^2\th ) } \label{e:gek:dtdl} \\
& \encadre{ \rho^2 \derd{r}{\lambda} = \eps_r \sqrt{ R(r) } } \label{e:gek:drdl}\\
& \encadre{ \rho^2 \derd{\th}{\lambda} = \eps_\th \sqrt{\Theta(\th)} } \label{e:gek:dthdl}\\
& \encadre{ \rho^2 \derd{\ph}{\lambda}  = \frac{L}{\sin^2\th} - a E
    + \frac{a}{\Delta}\left[(r^2 + a^2) E - a L\right] } , \label{e:gek:dphdl}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\eps_r := \operatorname{sgn} p^r = \pm 1$,  $\eps_\th := \operatorname{sgn} p^\th = \pm 1$
and the functions $R(r)$ and $\Theta(\th)$ are defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_R})
and Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}) or (\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}).
We may rewrite Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_R}) in terms of $Q$
instead of $\mathscr{K}$, via Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Q}):
\be \label{e:gek:def_R_Q}
   \encadre{ R(r) := \left[ (r^2 + a^2) E - a L \right]^ 2 - \Delta \left[ r^2 \mu^2 +  Q +(L-a E)^2) \right] }.
\ee
Note that besides the constants of motion $E$, $L$, $\mu$ and $Q$, $R(r)$ depends on the Kerr parameters $a$ and $m$
(via $\Delta = r^2 - 2 m r + a^2$), while $\Theta(\th)$
depends on $a$ only [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q})].
Along $\Li$, these functions must obey
$R(r) \geq 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:R_non_neg})] and $\Theta(\th) \geq 0$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_non_neg})].

In the system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order}), $\eps_r$
is $+1$ (resp. $-1$) in the parts of the geodesic $\Li$ where $r$ increases
(resp. decreases) with $\lambda$. Similarly, $\eps_\th$
is $+1$ (resp. $-1$) in the parts of $\Li$ where $\th$ increases
(resp. decreases) with $\lambda$.

\subsection{Turning points} \label{s:gek:turning_points}

Let $\Li$ be a geodesic that is not sticked at some constant value of the
coordinate $r$.
We define a \defin{$r$-turning point}\index{turning point!$r$-turning point} of $\Li$ as a point $p_0\in\Li$, the $r$-coordinate $r_0$ of which obeys
\be \label{e:gek:def_r_turning}
    R(r_0) = 0 \quad\mbox{and}\quad R'(r_0) \neq 0 ,
\ee
i.e. $r_0$ is a simple root of the polynomial $R$.

We have then
\be \label{e:gek:der_r_turning}
   \left. \derd{r}{\lambda} \right| _{\lambda_0} = 0
   \quad\mbox{and}\quad
   \left. \frac{\D^2 r}{\D\lambda^2} \right| _{\lambda_0} = \frac{R'(r_0)}{2\rho_0^4} \neq 0 ,
\ee
where $\lambda_0$ is the value of the affine parameter $\lambda$ at $p_0$
and $\rho_0 := \rho(p_0)$.
\begin{proof}
The vanishing of $\D r/\D\lambda$ at $\lambda_0$ follows immediately
from Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) with $R(r_0)=0$, since $\rho^2$ never vanishes
on $\M$. Besides, by
taking the derivative of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) with respect to $\lambda$, we
get
\[
    2 \left(r \derd{r}{\lambda} + a^2 \cos\th\sin\th \derd{\th}{\lambda} \right)
    \derd{r}{\lambda} + \rho^2 \frac{\D^2 r}{\D\lambda^2} =
    \eps_r \frac{R'(r)}{2\sqrt{R(r)}} \derd{r}{\lambda} = \frac{R'(r)}{2\rho^2} .
\]
At $\lambda=\lambda_0$, the first term in left-hand side vanishes identically,
due to the $\D r/\D\lambda$ factor,
and we get the second part of (\ref{e:gek:der_r_turning}).
\end{proof}

We deduce from the result (\ref{e:gek:der_r_turning}) that at $\lambda=\lambda_0$,
$\D r/\D\lambda$ moves from positive to negative values or vice-versa
(depending on the sign of $R'(r_0)$), which means that the function $r(\lambda)$
switches from increasing to decreasing or vice-versa, hence the name
\emph{$r$-turning point}. The factor $\eps_r=\pm 1$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) necessarily
changes sign at $\lambda=\lambda_0$.

\begin{remark} \label{r:gek:der_r_analytic}
For a generic smooth function $r(\lambda)$ with $\D r/\D \lambda=0$ at
$\lambda_0$, the condition $\D^2 r/\D\lambda^2\neq 0$ at $\lambda_0$
is sufficient but not necessary for $r$ to change its direction of variation there.
Indeed, the same property holds with $\D^2 r/\D\lambda^2= 0$ and higher order derivatives vanishing up to some even order $k$ for which
$\D^k r/\D\lambda^k\neq 0$. However, in the present case,
$\D^2 r/\D\lambda^2=0$ would imply $R'(r_0)=0$ and we shall see
Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values} that a geodesic can reach such a point only asymptotically,
i.e. for $\lambda\to +\infty$. Hence it cannot be a turning point.
\end{remark}


Similarly, if $\Li$ is a geodesic that is not sticked at some constant value of the
coordinate $\th$, we define a \defin{$\th$-turning point}\index{turning point!$\th$-turning point} of $\Li$ as a point $p_0\in\Li$, the
$\th$-coordinate $\th_0$ of which obeys
\be \label{e:gek:def_th_turning}
    \Theta(\th_0) = 0 \quad\mbox{and}\quad \Theta'(\theta_0) \neq 0 .
\ee
We deduce then from the equation of motion (\ref{e:gek:dthdl}):
\be \label{e:gek:der_th_turning}
   \left. \derd{\th}{\lambda} \right| _{\lambda_0} = 0
   \quad\mbox{and}\quad
   \left. \frac{\D^2 \th}{\D\lambda^2} \right| _{\lambda_0} = \frac{\Theta'(\th_0)}{2\rho_0^4} \neq 0 .
\ee
This implies that at a $\th$-turning point, the function $\th(\lambda)$
switches from increasing to decreasing or vice-versa. The factor $\eps_\th=\pm 1$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dthdl}) necessarily
changes sign at such a point.

\begin{remark}
A comment similar to Remark~\ref{r:gek:der_r_analytic} can be made:
a geodesic with varying $\th$ that has $\D\th/\D\lambda = 0$ for some finite
value of $\lambda$
cannot have $\D^2\th/\D\lambda^2 = 0$ at the same point, since we shall see
in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values}
that a value of $\th$ with both $\Theta(\th)=0$
and $\Theta'(\th)=0$ can only be reached asymptotically along a geodesic.
Hence (\ref{e:gek:def_th_turning})
is a necessary and sufficient condition for a $\th$-turning point.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Equations of motion in terms of Mino parameter} \label{s:gek:Mino_time}

In view of the right-hand sides of the system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order}),
it is quite natural to introduce along the geodesic $\Li$ the new
parameter $\lambda'$ defined by
\be \label{e:gek:def_Mino_time}
    \D\lambda' = \frac{\D\lambda}{\rho^2}
     = \frac{\D\lambda}{r(\lambda)^2 + a^2 \cos^2 \th(\lambda)} .
\ee
Since $\rho^2$ never vanishes on the spacetime manifold $\M$ (by construction
of the latter, cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_M_Kerr_spacetime})), the above relation
leads to a well-defined parameter along $\Li$. Moreover, since $\rho^2>0$, this
parameter increases towards the future, as $\lambda$. A difference between
the two parametrizations is that $\lambda'$ is not in general\footnote{The only
exception is for a circurlar orbit at $\theta=\pi/2$, since then $\rho^2$
is constant and Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Mino_time}) reduces to an affine relation
between $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$.} an affine parameter
of $\Li$, contrary to $\lambda$.
The parameter $\lambda'$ is called \defin{Mino parameter}\index{Mino!parameter}\index{parameter!Mino --} \cite{Mino03}.

In terms of Mino parameter, the system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order}) becomes
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:eom_Mino}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{ \derd{t}{\lambda'} = \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} [(r^2 + a^2) E - a L] + a ( L - a E \sin^2\th ) } \label{e:gek:dtdl_Mino} \\
& \encadre{ \derd{r}{\lambda'} = \eps_r \sqrt{ R(r) } } \label{e:gek:drdl_Mino}\\
& \encadre{ \derd{\th}{\lambda'} = \eps_\th \sqrt{\Theta(\th)} } \label{e:gek:dthdl_Mino}\\
& \encadre{ \derd{\ph}{\lambda'}  = \frac{L}{\sin^2\th} - a E
    + \frac{a}{\Delta}\left[(r^2 + a^2) E - a L\right] } , \label{e:gek:dphdl_Mino}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $R$ is the quartic polynomial defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_R_Q})
and $\Theta$ is the function defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}).
It is remarkable that Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino}) and (\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino})
are two fully decoupled equations: Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino}) is an ordinary
differential equation (ODE) for the function $r(\lambda')$, while Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino})
is an ordinary differential equation for the function $\th(\lambda')$. This was
not the case for Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) and (\ref{e:gek:dthdl}) since $\rho^2$ involves
both $r$ and $\th$.

\subsection{Integration of the geodesic equations} \label{e:gek:integration}

The ODE (\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino}) can be integrated by the method of separation
of variables. On a part of $\Li$ where $R(r)\neq 0$, this yields
\be \label{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}
    \lambda' - \lambda'_0 =  \int_{r_0}^r \frac{\eps_r\, \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}} ,
\ee
with $r_0 := r(\lambda'_0)$.
The hypothesis $R(r)\neq 0$
excludes any $r$-turning point between $\lambda'_0$ and $\lambda'$, so that
$\eps_r=\pm 1$ is constant along
the considered part of $\Li$.

Actually, the solution (\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R})
can be extended to include a turning point at one or two of its boundaries,
despite $R(r)=0$ there.
Indeed, let us assume that $r=r_1$ corresponds to a $r$-turning point of $\Li$.
Due to $R'(r_1)\neq 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_r_turning})], the
integral in the right-hand side of (\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}) with $r=r_1$
is finite. Indeed,
the Taylor expansion $R(\bar{r}) = R'(r_1) (\bar{r} - r_1) + O((\bar{r} - r_1)^2)$
makes the integral behave near $r_1$
as\footnote{We assume here $r_0<r_1$, so that the constraint
$R(\bar{r})\geq 0$ on the interval $[r_0,r_1]$ implies $R'(r_1)<0$.}
\[
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{-R'(r_1)}} \int_{r_0}^{r_1} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{r_1 - \bar{r}}} ,
\]
which is a convergent improper integral.
\begin{remark}
This is the same reasoning as in Sec.~\ref{s:gis:deflect_winding}.
\end{remark}

Let us assume that there are $M\geq 1$ $r$-turning points $p_1,\ldots, p_M$ between
$\lambda'_0$ and $\lambda'$. Their radial coordinates take at most two distinct values, $r_1$ and $r_2$, such
that $r(p_1) = r_1$, $r(p_2) = r_2$, $r(p_3) = r_1$, $r(p_4) = r_2$, etc.
From the above convergence property, the solution of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino})
is then
\be \label{e:gek:Minotime_r_sum}
    \lambda' - \lambda'_0 = \int_{r_0}^{r_1} \frac{\eps_r\, \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
    + (M-1) \int_{r_1}^{r_2} \frac{\eps_r\, \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
    + \int_{r_{1,2}}^r \frac{\eps_r\, \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}} ,
\ee
where $r_{1,2} = r_1$ for $M$ odd and $r_{1,2} = r_2$ for $M$ even.
Note that each term in the above sum
is positive, the sign of $\eps_r$ compensating the order of the integral
boundaries.

The right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Minotime_r_sum}) is actually a path
integral and is often abriged by means of a slash notation:
\be \label{e:gek:Minotime_r_slash_int}
    \lambda' - \lambda'_0 = \dashint_{r_0}^r \frac{\eps_r \, \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}} .
\ee

Similarly, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino}) can be integrated as
\bea
    \lambda' - \lambda'_0  & = & \dashint_{\th_0}^\th \frac{\eps_\th \, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}} \nonumber \\
    & = & \begin{cases}
        \displaystyle
       \int_{\th_0}^\th \frac{\eps_\th\, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}} & \ \mbox{if}\ N=0 \\[3ex]
       \displaystyle
       \int_{\th_0}^{\th_1} \frac{\eps_\th\, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}}
       + (N-1)
        \int_{\th_1}^{\th_2} \frac{\eps_\th\, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}}
        + \int_{\th_{1,2}}^{\th} \frac{\eps_\th\, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}}
         & \ \mbox{if}\ N\geq 1 ,
    \end{cases} \nonumber \\
    & &  \label{e:gek:Minotime_th_slash_int}
\eea
where $\th_0 := \th(\lambda'_0)$,
$N$ is the number of $\th$-turning points between $\lambda'_0$ and $\lambda'$,
$\theta_1$ (resp. $\theta_2$) is the value of $\th$ at the first (resp. second)
turning point, if any, $\th_{1,2} = \th_1$ for $N$ odd and $\th_{1,2} = \th_2$ for $N$ even.

We are now in position to state the full expression of the general
solution for geodesic motion:
\begin{greybox}
Let $\Li$ be a null or timelike geodesic in Kerr spacetime,
with conserved energy $E$, conserved angular momentum $L$, mass $\mu$ and
Carter constant $Q$. Let $\lambda$ be the affine parameter of $\Li$
associated with the 4-momentum $\w{p}$ and $\lambda'$ the
Mino parameter. If for $\lambda=\lambda_0$
$\Li$ lies at the point of Boyer-Lindquist coordinates $(t_0,r_0,\th_0,\ph_0)$,
then at any value of $\lambda$, the coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ along $\Li$
obey
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:integrated_eqs}
\begin{align}
 & \lambda' - \lambda'_0 = \dashint_{r_0}^r \frac{\eps_r \, \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
   = \dashint_{\th_0}^\th \frac{\eps_\th \, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}}
    \label{e:gek:integr_Mino}\\
 & \lambda - \lambda_0 = \dashint_{r_0}^r \frac{\eps_r \bar{r}^2 \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
    + a^2 \dashint_{\th_0}^\th \frac{\eps_\th \cos^2\bar{\th} \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}}
    \label{e:gek:integr_lambda} \\
 & t - t_0 = \dashint_{r_0}^r  \frac{\eps_r (\bar{r}^2 + a^2)}{\bar{r}^2 - 2m \bar{r} + a^2}
 \left[ (\bar{r}^2 + a^2) E - a L \right] \frac{\D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
 + a \dashint_{\th_0}^\th ( L - a E \sin^2\bar{\th} ) \frac{\eps_\th \, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}} \label{e:gek:integr_t} \\
 & \ph - \ph_0 = a \dashint_{r_0}^r  \frac{(\bar{r}^2 + a^2)E - a L}{\bar{r}^2 - 2m \bar{r} + a^2}
    \frac{\eps_r \, \D \bar{r}}{\sqrt{R(\bar{r})}}
    + \dashint_{\th_0}^\th \left( \frac{L}{\sin^2\bar{\th}} - a E  \right) \frac{\eps_\th \, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}} , \label{e:gek:integr_ph}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $R$ is the quartic polynomial defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_R_Q}) (see also Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:R_r_powers}) below) and $\Theta$ is the function defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}).
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
Equation~(\ref{e:gek:integr_Mino}) is nothing but the gathering of
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:Minotime_r_slash_int}) and (\ref{e:gek:Minotime_th_slash_int}).
For Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_lambda}), it suffices to rewrite Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Mino_time})
as
\[
    \D\lambda = r^2 \, \D\lambda' + a^2\cos^2\th \, \D\lambda'
\]
and to substitute $\D\lambda'$ by $\eps_r \D r / \sqrt{R(r)}$
in the first term [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl_Mino})] and by
$\eps_\th \D\th / \sqrt{\Theta(\th)}$ in the second term [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino})].
Similarly, by rewriting Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl_Mino}) as
\[
    \D t = \frac{r^2 + a^2}{r^2 - 2mr + a^2} [(r^2 + a^2) E - a L] \, \D\lambda'
        + a ( L - a E \sin^2\th ) \, \D\lambda'
\]
and performing the same substitutions for $\D\lambda'$ as above, we get
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_t}). Finally, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_ph}) is deduced
in the same fashion from Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dphdl_Mino}).
\end{proof}

The system (\ref{e:gek:integrated_eqs}) shows that the geodesic motion can be
fully solved in terms of the Mino parameter $\lambda'$. Indeed,
the integral on $r$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_Mino}) can be evaluated by
means of elliptic integrals since $R$ is a polynomial of degree 4. This provides
$\lambda' = \lambda'(r)$. Inverting this relation via Jacobi elliptic functions
(cf. Remark~\ref{r:gis:Jacobi_elliptic_sine} on p.~\pageref{r:gis:Jacobi_elliptic_sine})
yields $r = r(\lambda')$. The integral on $\th$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_Mino})
can be evaluated by means of elliptic integrals as well since the change of variable
$\zeta := \cos\th$ along with expression (\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}) for $\Theta(\th)$ results in
\[
\dashint_{\th_0}^\th \frac{\eps_\th \, \D \bar{\th}}{\sqrt{\Theta(\bar{\th})}}
= - \dashint_{\zeta_0}^\zeta
\frac{\eps_\th \, \D \bar{\zeta}}{\sqrt{Q(1-\bar{\zeta}^2) + \bar{\zeta}^2[a^2(E^2-\mu^2)(1-\bar{\zeta}^2) - L^2]}} ,
\]
with the term under the square root in the right-hand side being a polynomial of degree 4
in $\bar{\zeta}$.
The use of Jacobi elliptic functions leads then to $\th = \th(\lambda')$.
From $r(\lambda')$ and $\th(\lambda')$ one can get $\lambda(\lambda')$,
$t(\lambda')$ and $\ph(\lambda')$
by evaluating the integrals in the right-hand sides of
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_lambda})--(\ref{e:gek:integr_ph}). Again, these integrals are
reducible to elliptic integrals. We shall not give the details of all the
elliptic integrals computations, refering the reader to Ref.~\cite{FujitH09}
for bound timelike geodesics and to Ref.~\cite{GrallaL20b} for null geodesics.

%\subsection{Equations of motion in terms of 3+1 Kerr coordinates}

%It is interesting to write the first-order equations of geodesic motion
%in terms of the 3+1 Kerr coordinates $(\ti,r,\th,\tph)$ introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:3p1_Kerr_coord}, since these coordinates are regular on the event
%horizon $\Hor$, contrary to the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$
%considered above.


\begin{hist}
The constant of motion $\mathscr{K}$ has been discovered by Brandon Carter\index{Carter, B.}
in 1968 \cite{Carte68a}, in a study about  Kerr-Newman spacetimes\index{Kerr-Newman!spacetime},
which generalize the Kerr ones to nonzero global electric charge.
Carter actually did not get $\mathscr{K}$ from the Killing tensor $\w{K}$,
which was discovered two years later by Martin Walker\index{Walker, M.} and
Roger Penrose\index{Penrose, R.} \cite{WalkeP70}; he
started instead from the Lagrangian (\ref{e:geo:Lagrangian2}) governing
both timelike and null geodesics,
derived the corresponding
Hamiltonian as $H = g^{\mu\nu} p_\mu p_\nu$ (for the uncharged (i.e. Kerr) case)
and discovered that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\index{Hamilton-Jacobi equation}
is separable, i.e. can be solved by separation of variables.
$\mathscr{K}$ appeared then as a separation constant. Note that Carter used
the Kerr coordinates\footnote{Carter's $u$ is our $v$.}
$(v,r,\th,\tph)$ described in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Kerr_coord}
and not the Boyer-Lindquist ones.
Carter also introduced
the constant $Q$ via Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Q}). He obtained the equivalent
of the first-order system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order}) for the Kerr coordinates. Actually
two of his equations, those for $\D r/\D\lambda$ and $\D\th/\D\lambda$, are
identical to Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:drdl}) and (\ref{e:gek:dthdl}) of the Boyer-Lindquist
system. This is not surprising since the coordinates
$r$ and $\th$ are the same in both systems. Carter's equations for the
Kerr coordinates $v$ and $\tph$ are slightly more complicated than
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) and (\ref{e:gek:dphdl}) for the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
$t$ and $\ph$. It seems that the Boyer-Lindquist first-order system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order})
has been first derived by Daniel Wilkins\index{Wilkins, D.} in 1972 \cite{Wilki72},
starting from Carter's system and performing the transformation to Boyer-Lindquist
coordinates. The integrated geodesic equations (\ref{e:gek:integrated_eqs}) have
been obtained by Carter in 1968 \cite{Carte68a}: Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_Mino})
(without the $\lambda' - \lambda'_0$ part) is Eq.~(58) of Ref.~\cite{Carte68a}
and Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_lambda}) is Eq.~(59) of Ref.~\cite{Carte68a}.
Regarding Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_t}) and (\ref{e:gek:integr_ph}), Carter
obtained equivalent ones for the Kerr coordinates $v$ and $\tph$ which he was using
[his Eqs.~(60) and (61)].

\section{General properties of geodesics}

\subsection{Sign of $E$}

We have:
\begin{greybox}
If a null or timelike geodesic $\Li$ has some part lying outside the ergoregion $\mathscr{G}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ker:ergoregion}),
then the conserved energy $E$ defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_E}) is necessarily positive:
\be \label{e:gek:E_positive}
    \Li \not\subset \mathscr{G}\quad \Longrightarrow \quad E > 0 .
\ee
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
By the very definition of the ergoregion $\mathscr{G}$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ker:ergoregion}),
the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ is timelike outside $\mathscr{G}$. Moreover it is
future-directed there, given the time orientation defined in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:time_orientation}.
The 4-momentum $\w{p}$ is either timelike or null and always future-directed.
By Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:orient_time1}) in Lemma~1 of Sec.~\ref{s:fra:time_orientation}, one has then necessarily $\w{\xi}\cdot\w{p} < 0$; hence
$E := - \w{\xi}\cdot\w{p} > 0$ in $\M\setminus \mathscr{G}$. Since $E$ is constant along $\Li$, it
follows that $E > 0$ everywhere.
\end{proof}
In particular, any timelike or null geodesic that reaches one of the asymptotic regions
$r\to\pm\infty$ has $E>0$.
\begin{remark}
The property (\ref{e:gek:E_positive}) generalizes that obtained for Schwarzschild spacetime [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:E_positive_M_I})] to
the case $a\not=0$, since for Schwarzschild spacetime, the exterior of the ergoregion
is nothing but the exterior of the black hole region.
\end{remark}

Inside the ergoregion, the Killing vector $\w{\xi}$ is spacelike and $E$ can be
either positive, zero or negative.
We have already encountered geodesics with $E=0$ in Example~\ref{x:gek:null_generator_hor} of Sec.~\ref{s:gek:int_motion_sym}: the null generators of the horizons $\Hor$
and $\Hor_{\rm in}$.
Particles for which $E<0$ are called
\defin{negative-energy particles}\index{negative-energy particle}\index{particle!negative-energy --}. They are those involved in the Penrose process discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Penrose_proc}.
Note that according to (\ref{e:gek:E_positive}) a negative-energy particle cannot exist
outside the ergoregion.

\subsection{Future-directed condition}

Not all values of the constant of motions $(\mu,E,L,Q)$ lead to a solution
$x^\alpha(\lambda)$ of the first-order system (\ref{e:gek:eom_first_order})
that is future-directed, i.e. such that $\w{p} = \D \w{x}/\D\lambda$
is oriented everywhere to the future.
The latter condition is equivalent to have the affine parameter $\lambda$ increase
towards the future along the geodesic $\Li$, as we are demanding in all
our study (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:geod_motion_intro}).
In particular, this allows one to identify $\lambda$ with the proper
time when $\Li$ is timelike.


As discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:time_orientation}, the time orientation of
the Kerr spacetime $(\M,\w{g})$ is set by the global null
vector field $\w{k}$ generating the ingoing principal null geodesics, cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_k_hat_r}). By virtue of Lemma~2 of Sec.~\ref{s:fra:time_orientation}
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:orient_null1})], we have then, for $\w{p}$ not collinear
with $\w{k}$ (in particular for $\Li$ timelike),
\[
    \w{p} \ \mbox{future-directed} \iff \w{g}(\w{k},\w{p}) < 0
    \iff k^\mu p_\mu < 0
    \iff \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} p_t - p_r + \frac{a}{\Delta} p_\ph < 0 ,
\]
where the last inequality follows from the Boyer-Lindquist components
(\ref{e:ker:k_BL}) of $\w{k}$.
Given the identities $p_t = -E$, $p_\ph = L$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:E_pt_L_pph})] and $p_r = \eps_r \sqrt{R(r)}/ \Delta $
[Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:p_r_p_th_cov_con})
and (\ref{e:gek:drdl})], we conclude that
\begin{greybox}
\be \label{e:gek:future_directed}
{\Li \ \mbox{timelike or}\atop
\w{k} \ \mbox{not tangent to} \ \Li} \implies
\encadre{ \frac{1}{\Delta} \left[ (r^2 + a^2) E - a L
+ \eps_r \sqrt{R(r)} \right] > 0 } .
\ee
\end{greybox}
Given expression (\ref{e:gek:def_R_Q}) for $R(r)$ and
$\Delta := r^2 - 2m r + a^2$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_Delta})],
we note that this constraint involves $(\mu,E,L,Q)$ and $r$, but not $\th$.

Another constraint is obtained by considering, instead of $\w{k}$, the
vector field $\w{N}$ normal to the hypersurfaces of constant
Boyer-Lindquist coordinate $t$, which has been introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:ZAMO}:
$\w{N} = - \overrightarrow{\dd t}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:N_grad_t})].
As shown in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:ZAMO}, $\w{N}$ is future-directed timelike
in the subpart $\M_{\rm ZAMO} := \M_{\rm I} \cup (\M_{\rm III}\setminus \mathscr{T})$
of Kerr spacetime. Lemma~1 of Sec.~\ref{s:fra:time_orientation} [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:orient_time1})]
then yields
\[
    \w{p} \ \mbox{future-directed in} \ \M_{\rm ZAMO} \iff \w{g}(\w{N},\w{p}) < 0
    \iff - \underbrace{\langle \dd t, \w{p} \rangle}_{p^t} < 0 \iff p^t > 0 .
\]
Hence the Boyer-Lindquist component $p^t$ of the 4-momentum $\w{p}$ must be positive
in $\M_{\rm ZAMO}$:
\begin{greybox}
\be \label{e:gek:p_t_positive}
    \encadre{ p^t > 0 } \ \ \mbox{in}\ \M_{\rm I} \cup (\M_{\rm III}\setminus \mathscr{T}) .
\ee
\end{greybox}
Let us recall that $\mathscr{T}$ is the Carter time machine\index{Carter!time machine}\index{time!machine (Carter)} (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:ker:time_machine}),
which occupies a very limited portion of $\M_{\rm III}$.
Using $p^t = \D t/\D\lambda$, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) and the fact that $\Delta > 0$
in $\M_{\rm I} \cup \M_{\rm III}$, we get the equivalent
constraint
\[
    (r^2 + a^2) [(r^2 + a^2) E - a L]  + a \Delta ( L - a E \sin^2\th ) > 0
      \ \mbox{in}\ \M_{\rm I} \cup (\M_{\rm III}\setminus \mathscr{T}) ,
\]
which can be simplified to
\begin{greybox}
\be
\encadre{ \rho^2 (r^2 + a^2) E - 2 a m r ( L - a E \sin^2\th ) > 0 }
\ \ \mbox{in}\ \M_{\rm I} \cup (\M_{\rm III}\setminus \mathscr{T}) .
\ee
\end{greybox}

\begin{remark}
In the outer ergoregion  $\mathscr{G}^+ = \mathscr{G}\cap \M_{\rm I}$
(i.e. the part of the ergoregion outside of the black hole),
$E<0$ is allowed, but the result
(\ref{e:gek:p_t_positive}) shows that $p^t < 0$ is not allowed.
\end{remark}

Yet another future-directed constraint stems from the vector $\w{\veps}_{(0)}$
of the Carter frame\index{Carter!frame} introduced in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:Carter_obs}.
As shown there, $\w{\veps}_{(0)}$ is a future-directed timelike vector in all
$\M_{\rm I} \cup \M_{\rm III}$.
We can then apply Lemma~1 of Sec.~\ref{s:fra:time_orientation}, using
expression~(\ref{e:ker:Carter_frame_0}) of $\w{\veps}_{(0)}$ in terms of
$\w{\xi}=\wpar_t$ and $\w{\eta}=\wpar_\ph$:
\[
   \w{p} \ \mbox{future-directed in} \ \M_{\rm I} \cup \M_{\rm III} \iff \w{g}(\w{\veps}_{(0)},\w{p}) < 0
   \iff (r^2 + a^2) \underbrace{\w{g}(\w{\xi}, \w{p})}_{-E} + a \underbrace{\w{g}(\w{\eta}, \w{p})}_{L} < 0 .
\]
Hence the constraint
\begin{greybox}
\be
    \encadre{ (r^2 + a^2) E - a L > 0 } \ \ \mbox{in}\ \M_{\rm I} \cup \M_{\rm III} .
\ee
\end{greybox}

An immediate corollary of the above result is:
\begin{greybox}
In the outer ergoregion\index{outer!ergoregion}\index{ergoregion!outer --}
$\mathscr{G}^+ = \mathscr{G}\cap \M_{\rm I}$, a geodesic that has $E < 0$
must have $L<0$ as well.
\end{greybox}

\begin{hist}
That $E < 0$ in the outer ergoregion implies $L<0$ has been shown for
equatorial geodesics by George Contopoulos\index{Contopoulos, G.} in 1984 \cite{Conto84}.
\end{hist}

\subsection{Lense-Thirring effect} \label{s:gek:Lense-Thirring}

Let us consider a null or timelike geodesic $\Li$ with a vanishing angular
momentum: $L=0$. The equations of motion (\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) and (\ref{e:gek:dphdl})
reduce to
\begin{align}
& \rho^2 \derd{t}{\lambda} = E \left( \frac{(r^2 + a^2)^2}{\Delta}   - a^2 \sin^2\th \right)
= \frac{E}{\Delta} \left[ \rho^2(r^2 + a^2) + 2 a^2 m r \sin^2\th \right] \nonumber \\
& \rho^2 \derd{\ph}{\lambda}  = a E \left( - 1 + \frac{r^2 + a^2}{\Delta} \right)
 = \frac{2 a m r}{\Delta} , \nonumber
\end{align}
so that we get
\be \label{e:gek:dphdt_frame_dragging}
    \encadre{ \left. \frac{\D\ph}{\D t} \right| _\Li  =
        \frac{2 a m r}{\rho^2(r^2 + a^2) + 2 a^2 m r \sin^2\th} } _{\ L=0}.
\ee
Hence, for $a\neq 0$, a geodesic with zero angular momentum about the
symmetry axis has nevertheless a rotational motion around that axis.
This is a manifestation of the \defin{Lense-Thirring effect}\index{Lense-Thirring effect},
also called \defin{dragging of inertial frames}\index{dragging!of inertial frames}, or, in short, \defin{frame dragging}\index{frame!dragging}\index{dragging!frame --}.

The Lense-Thirring effect is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:frame_dragging}
which shows the trajectory a timelike particle with $L=0$
which was asympotically at rest (marginally bound particle, having $E=\mu$,
to be discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:r-motion}). The trajectory was initialy
radial, but as $r$ decreases, $\D\ph/\D t$ increases according to formula
(\ref{e:gek:dphdt_frame_dragging}).
In Fig.~\ref{f:gek:frame_dragging} and in all figures of this chapter, we are
using the \defin{Cartesian Boyer-Lindquist coordinates}\index{Cartesian!Boyer-Lindquist coordinates}
$(t,x,y,z)$, which are
defined in the $r>0$ region of Kerr spacetime and are related to the
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ by the standard transformation
from spherical to Cartesian coordinates:
\be \label{e:gek:Cartesian_BL}
    x := r\sin\th\cos\ph,\qquad
    y := r\sin\th\sin\ph,\qquad
    z := r\cos\th .
\ee

We note that, at a given point $(r,\th)$, the angular velocity (\ref{e:gek:dphdt_frame_dragging})
coincides with that of the zero-angular momentum observer (ZAMO) at that point
[compare Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:omega_ZAMO})].

\subsection{Winding near the event horizon and the inner horizon}

Let us consider a null or timelike geodesic $\Li$ in the vicinity of the
black hole event horizon $\Hor$.
On $\Hor$, $r=r_+$ and $\Delta = 0$. Then, the term
$\Delta^{-1}$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) makes $\D t/\D\lambda$ diverge as
$r\to r_+$, except in the very special where $(r_+^2 + a^2)E - aL = 0$, which
is equivalent to $E = \Omega_H L$ according to Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_OmegaH}).
Similarly, $\D\ph/\D\lambda$, as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dphdl}), diverges
as $r\to r_+$, except for $E = \Omega_H L$. These two divergences are not
a pathology of $\Li$ per se; they
reflect merely the singularity of Boyer-Lindquist coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ at $\Hor$
(cf.  Sec.~\ref{s:ker:singularities}). However, we read on Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) and
(\ref{e:gek:dphdl}) that the ratio
$\left. \D\ph/\D t \right| _{\Li} := \D\ph/\D\lambda \times (\D t/\D\lambda)^{-1}$
converges to a finite value:
\be \label{e:gek:lim_dphdt_Hor}
    \lim_{r\to r_+} \left. \derd{\ph}{t} \right| _{\Li} = \frac{a}{r_+^2 + a^2} = \Omega_H ,
\ee
where the second equality follows from Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_OmegaH}), letting
the black hole rotation velocity $\Omega_H$ appear.
Hence we conclude that
\begin{greybox}
Any null or timelike geodesic that approaches the event horizon $\Hor$
is winding around it in terms of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates at exactly the black hole rotation velocity $\Omega_H$.
\end{greybox}
If $\Li$ is a timelike geodesic, we have argued in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:circular_orbits}
that $\left. \D\ph/\D t \right| _{\Li}$ can be interpreted as the angular velocity of
$\Li$ as seen by an asymptotic ($r\to +\infty$) inertial observer. The reasoning was
given in the Schwarzschild spacetime context but it actually  involved only
the spacetime symmetry by translation in $t$, so it is applicable here.


\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{gek_winding_null.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:gek:winding_null} \footnotesize
Trajectory in the equatorial plane of an incoming null geodesic with
$L=-6E < 0$ and $Q=0$, plunging into a Kerr black hole with $a = 0.998 \, m$.
Note the turning point in $\ph$ and the final winding in the direction of the black
rotation (counterclockwise in the figure). The figure is drawn in terms
of the Cartesian Boyer-Lindquist coordinates $(x,y)$ defined by
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Cartesian_BL}) with $\th=\pi/2$ (equatorial plane)
and the grey disk marks the black hole region.
\textsl{[Figure generated by the notebook \ref{s:sam:Kerr_geod_plots}]}
}
\end{figure}


\begin{remark}
When $a\not=0$,
a geodesic that starts far from the black hole with
$\left. \D\ph/\D t \right| _{\Li} < 0$ [according to Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dphdl}) with $r\gg m$,
this occurs for $L <0$]
must necessarily have a turning point in $\ph$
if it reaches the event horizon, in order to fulfill (\ref{e:gek:lim_dphdt_Hor}),
where $\Omega_H$ is positive. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:winding_null}
and is in sharp contrast with the Schwarzschild case, where $\ph$ is always
a monotonous function of $\lambda$, as shown in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:eq_to_be_solved}.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
The winding property does not hold for the Kerr or 3+1 Kerr coordinates. Indeed,
we have seen in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:principal_geod} that the
ingoing principal null geodesics $\Li^{\rm in}_{(v,\th,\tph)}$ are geodesics
along which $\tph$ is constant. They are therefore not winding in terms
of neither the Kerr coordinates $(v,r,\th,\tph)$ nor the 3+1 Kerr ones $(\ti,r,\th,\tph)$.
This difference of (coordinate) behaviour is understandable if one considers
the diverging behaviour in $\Delta^{-1}$ of the
relation $\D \tph = \D \ph + a/\Delta\, \D r$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:Kerr_coord_tph})]
between the angular coordinates $\ph$ and $\tph$.
\end{remark}

Regarding the Boyer-Lindqust coordinate behaviour in the vicinity of the inner
horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$ (corresponding to the second root $r_-$ of $\Delta$), we deduce
from
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdl}) and
(\ref{e:gek:dphdl}) that
\be
    \lim_{r\to r_-} \left. \derd{\ph}{t} \right| _{\Li} = \frac{a}{r_-^2 + a^2} = \Omega_{\rm in} ,
\ee
where the second equality follows from Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_Omega_in}); it involves
the rotation velocity $\Omega_{\rm in}$ of the inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$.
Hence
\begin{greybox}
Any null or timelike geodesic that approaches the inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$
is winding around it in terms of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates at exactly the
rotation velocity $\Omega_{\rm in}$ of $\Hor_{\rm in}$.
\end{greybox}

\subsection{Asymptotic $r$-values and $\th$-values} \label{s:gek:asymptotic_values}

Let us reconsider the argument in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:Mino_time}
that lead to extend the integral
(\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}) to $r=r_1$, where $r_1$ corresponded to
a $r$-turning point, i.e. fulfilled $R(r_1)=0$ and $R'(r_1)\neq 0$.
If we assume instead that $R(r_1)=0$, $R'(r_1)=0$ and
$R''(r_1)\neq 0$, i.e. that $r_1$ is a double root of the polynomial $R$,
the integral in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}) with $r=r_1$ behaves
near $r_1$ as
\[
    \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{R''(r_1)}} \int_{r_0}^{r_1} \frac{\D \bar{r}}{r_1 - \bar{r}} ,
\]
which is a divergent improper integral. If $r_1$ is a higher order root of $R$,
the divergence is even worse, being trigered by a higher power of $1/(r_1 - \bar{r})$.
Consequently, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:lp_int_dr_ov_R}) with $r=r_1$
implies that the Mino parameter diverges: $\lambda'\to +\infty$. Since $\rho^2 > 0$,
provided that $\rho^2$
does not tend to $0$ (the ring singularity) as $\lambda'\to +\infty$, this
implies that the affine parameter $\lambda$ tends to $+\infty$ as well, given
the relation (\ref{e:gek:def_Mino_time}) between the two parameters.
Hence we conclude
\begin{greybox}
Let $\Li$ be a geodesic of Kerr spacetime and $R(r)$ the associated polynomial
(\ref{e:gek:def_R_Q}).
A point away from the ring singularity $\ring$ and of $r$-coordinate $r_1$
such that both $R(r_1) = 0$ and $R'(r_1) = 0$
can only be reached asymptotically by $\Li$, i.e. in the limit
$\lambda\to \pm\infty$ of the affine parameter
$\lambda$. We call $r_1$ an \defin{asymptotic $r$-value}\index{asymptotic!$r$-value} of the geodesic $\Li$.
\end{greybox}
This property explains why $R(r_0) = 0$ and $R'(r_0) \neq 0$ is a necessary condition
to have a $r$-turning point (cf. Remark~\ref{r:gek:der_r_analytic} on page~\pageref{r:gek:der_r_analytic}).

By the same reasoning, we have
\begin{greybox}
Let $\Li$ be a geodesic of Kerr spacetime and $\Theta(\th)$ the associated function
(\ref{e:gek:def_Theta}).
A point away from the ring singularity $\ring$ and of $\th$-coordinate $\th_1$
such that both $\Theta(\th_1) = 0$ and $\Theta'(\th_1) = 0$
can only be reached asymptotically by $\Li$, i.e. in the limit
$\lambda\to \pm\infty$ of the affine parameter
$\lambda$. We call $\th_1$ an
\defin{asymptotic $\th$-value}\index{asymptotic!$\th$-value} of the geodesic $\Li$.
\end{greybox}



\subsection{$\th$-motion} \label{s:gek:th_motion}

We start by analysing the variation of the $\th$ coordinate along a geodesic,
as governed by the decoupled equation
(\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino}), since this provides some constraints
to discuss later the $r$-motion.

Given expression~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}) for $\Theta(\th)$,
the first-order equation of motion (\ref{e:gek:dthdl_Mino}) can be rewritten as
\be \label{e:gek:th_eff_potential}
    \encadre{ \left( \derd{\th}{\lambda'} \right)^2 + V(\th) = Q },
\ee
with
\be \label{e:gek:def_V_th}
  \encadre{  V(\th) := \cos^2\th \left[ a^2(\mu^2 - E^2) + \frac{L^2}{\sin^2\th} \right] }.
\ee
Note that $V(\th)$ is related to $\Theta(\th)$ by
\be
    \Theta(\th) = Q - V(\th).
\ee
In particular, the $\th$-turning points (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:turning_points})
are characterized by
$V(\th) = Q$ and $V'(\th) \neq 0$, while the asymptotic $\th$-values
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values})
correspond to $V(\th) = Q$ and $V'(\th) = 0$.

We recognize in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_potential}) the first integral of a
(non-relativistic) 1-dimensional motion in the potential $V(\th)$, which we
shall call the
\defin{effective $\th$-potential}\index{effective!$\th$-potential}.
The discussion of the geodesic $\th$-motion
is then based on the properties of that potential, $Q$
in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_potential})
playing the role of
the constant ``total energy''. Since $(\D\th / \D\lambda')^2 \geq 0$,
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_potential})  implies
\be \label{e:gek:V_leq_Q}
    V(\th) \leq Q .
\ee
Accordingly, given a plot of $V(\th)$, as in Figs.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0} and
\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}, the allowed range of $\th$ is determined
by the part of the graph of $V(\th)$ that lies below
the horizontal line of ordinate equal to $Q$.

We shall distinguish the
case $L=0$ from $L\not=0$, since the shape of $V(\th)$
is different in these two cases.



\subsubsection{Geodesics with $L=0$}

If $L=0$, the effective $\th$-potential reduces to $V(\th)=a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)\cos^2\th$.
We have then three subcases:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2 E^2 < a^2 \mu^2 \iff a\neq 0 \ \mbox{and}\ |E| < \mu$:
the corresponding graph of $V(\th)$ is shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0} (left part); we deduce immediately from it that
$Q\geq 0$, with
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=0$: the motion is confined to the equatorial
plane $\th=\pi/2$; since it corresponds to a minimum of the effective potential, this
is a stable configuration.
\item $0<Q< a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)$: $\th$ ocillates between
two turning points, which are symmetric about the equatorial plane:
$\th_0 := \arccos\sqrt{Q/(a^2(\mu^2 - E^2))}$
and $\pi-\th_0$ (cf. the trajectory $Q=Q_1$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0}, left).
\item $Q = a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)$: $\th=0$ and $\th=\pi$
are either unstable positions or
asymptotic $\th$-values (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values}), i.e.
the geodesic reaches the rotation axis for $\lambda\to\pm\infty$.
\item $Q > a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)$:
the range of $\th$ is not limited (cf. the trajectory $Q=Q_2$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0}, left)
and each time the geodesic reaches the
rotation axis ($\th=0$ or $\th=\pi$),
it crosses it, since the velocity $\D\th / \D\lambda'$
does not vanish there. This leads to $\th < 0$ or $\th > \pi$; to keep $\th$
within the interval $[0,\pi]$, one shall use the identification
of the points $(\th, \ph)$, $(-\th, \ph+\pi)$ and $(\th-\pi, \ph+\pi)$,
which holds on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2 E^2 = a^2\mu^2 \iff a=0\ \mbox{or}\ |E|=\mu$:
$V(\th)=0$ and Eq.(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_potential})
reduces to $(\D\th/\D\lambda')^2 = Q$. This implies $Q\geq 0$, with
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=0$: the geodesic lies at a constant value of $\th$, within the range
$[0,\pi]$.
\item $Q>0$: the solution is $\th(\lambda') = \pm \sqrt{Q}\, \lambda' + \th_0$, which
means that $\th$ varies monotically along the geodesic, crossing the rotation
axis an infinite number of times.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2 E^2 > a^2 \mu^2 \iff a\neq 0 \ \mbox{and}\  |E|>\mu$:
the corresponding graph of $V(\th)$ is shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0} (right part); the Carter constant must obey
$Q \geq - a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2)$, with
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=-a^2(E^2 - \mu^2)$: only $\th=0$ and
$\th=\pi$ are possible and they correspond to minima of $V(\th)$;
the geodesic is then stably located on the rotation axis.
\item $-a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) < Q < 0$: the geodesic oscillates about the rotation
axis, without reaching the equator; one has either $\th\in[0,\th_0]$ or
$\th\in [\pi - \th_0,\pi]$, with the turning point value
$\th_0 := \arccos\sqrt{|Q|/(a^2(E^2 - \mu^2))} < \pi/2$ (cf. the trajectories $Q=Q_1$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0}, right).
\item $Q=0$: $\th=\pi/2$ is either an unstable position or
an asymptotic $\th$-value, i.e. the geodesic approaches the equatorial
plane when $\lambda\to\pm\infty$.
\item $Q>0$: $\th$ varies in all the range $[0,\pi]$; when
the geodesic reaches the rotation axis, it crosses it (cf. the trajectory $Q=Q_2$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0}, right).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Geodesics with $L\not=0$}

When $L\not=0$, we see from expression~(\ref{e:gek:def_V_th}) that
$V(\th) \to +\infty$ when $\th\to 0$ or $\pi$.
We conclude immediately that the geodesic cannot reach the rotation axis
for $L\not=0$.
Moreover, we have
\[
    \derd{V}{\th} = - 2 \cos\th\sin\th \left[ a^2 (\mu^2 - E^2) + \frac{L^2}{\sin^4\th} \right] .
\]
The extrema of $V$ in $(0,\pi)$ are then given by
\be
    \derd{V}{\th} = 0 \iff
        \th = \frac{\pi}{2} \quad\mbox{or}\quad
        \sin^4\th = \frac{L^2}{a^2(E^2 - \mu^2)} .
\ee
We are thus led to distinguish two cases, depending whether or not the
equation involving $\sin^4\th$ has solutions distinct from $\pi/2$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) \leq L^2 \iff a=0\
\mbox{or}\ |E| \leq \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{L^2}{a^2}}$: the only extremum solution is
$\th=\pi/2$.
Its value is $V(\pi/2)=0$ and it is
necessarily a miminum, since $V(\th) \to +\infty$ at the boundaries of the
interval $[0,\pi]$ (cf. left part of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}).
Hence one must have $Q\geq 0$, with
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=0$: the geodesic stays stably in the
equatorial plane.
\item $Q>0$: the geodesic oscillates about the equatorial plane,
between two turning points at $\th=\th_0$ and $\pi-\th_0$, $\th_0$ being the solution
of $V(\th_0) = Q$ in $(0,\pi/2)$ (cf. the trajectory $Q=Q_1$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}, left).
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case} $a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) > L^2 \iff a\neq 0\
\mbox{and}\ |E| > \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{L^2}{a^2}}$: $V(\th)$ has three extrema (cf. right part of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}), which are located at
$\th=\th_*$, $\pi/2$ and $\pi-\th_*$ with
\be
    \th_* := \arcsin\sqrt{\frac{|L|}{a\sqrt{E^2 - \mu^2}}}
    \quad\mbox{and}\quad 0 < \th_* < \frac{\pi}{2} .
\ee
$\th_*$ and $\pi-\th_*$ correspond to the minimum of $V(\th)$,
while $\pi/2$ corresponds to a local maximum. The minimum is
$V(\th_*) = (1-\sin^2\th_*)(a^2(\mu^2-E^2) + L^2/\sin^2\th_*) = - (a \sqrt{E^2 - \mu^2} - |L|)^2$.
This is necessary the minimal value of $Q$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:V_leq_Q})]:
\be
    Q_{\rm min} = - \left( a \sqrt{E^2 - \mu^2} - |L| \right) ^2 .
\ee
We have then (cf. right part of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0})
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q = Q_{\rm min}$: the geodesic stays stably at a fixed value of $\th$,
either $\th_*$ or $\pi - \th_*$.
\item $Q_{\rm min} < Q < 0$: the geodesic oscillates between two turning
points either in the Northen
hemisphere ($\th < \pi/2$) or the Southern one ($\th > \pi/2$), without reaching
the equator nor the rotation axis (cf. the trajectories $Q=Q_1$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}, right).
\item $Q=0$: the geodesic lies unstably in the equatorial plane or
moves asymptotically towards it (possibly after a turning point at $\th_0\neq\pi/2$), $\pi/2$ being an asymptotic $\th$-value, since $\Theta'(\pi/2) = - V'(\pi/2)=0$
(cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values}).
\item $Q>0$: the geodesic oscillates about the equatorial plane,
between two turning points at $\th=\th_0$ and $\pi-\th_0$, $\th_0$ being the solution
of $V(\th_0) = Q$ in $(0,\pi/2)$ (cf. the trajectory $Q=Q_2$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0}, right).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We can summarize the above results by
\begin{greybox}
\begin{itemize}
\item A geodesic $\Li$ of Kerr spacetime cannot encounter the rotation axis unless it has $L=0$.
\item If $a=0$ (Schwarzschild limit) or $|E| \leq \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{L^2}{a^2}}$,
the Carter constant $Q$ is necessarily non-negative:
\be \label{e:gek:Q_nonnegative}
    Q \geq 0 .
\ee
\item The Carter constant $Q$ can take negative values only if
$a\neq 0$ and $|E| > \sqrt{\mu^2 + \frac{L^2}{a^2}}$; its range is then
limited from below:
\be
    Q \geq Q_{\rm min} = - \left( a \sqrt{E^2 - \mu^2} - |L| \right) ^2.
\ee
A geodesic with $Q<0$ is called \defin{vortical}\index{vortical geodesic}; it
never encounters the equatorial plane.
\item If $Q>0$, $\Li$ oscillates symmetrically about the equatorial plane,
between two turning points, $\th_0$ and $\pi-\th_0$, such that $0<\th_0<\pi/2$,
except for two subcases with $L=0$: (i) $Q = a^2 (\mu^2 - E^2)$: $\Li$
lies unstably along the rotation axis or approaches it asymptotically
and (ii) $Q >a^2(\mu^2 - E^2)$: $\Li$
crosses repeatedly the rotation axis, with $\th$ taking all values in the
range $[0,\pi]$.
\item If $Q=0$, $\Li$ is stably confined to the equatorial plane
for $a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2) < L^2$ or $a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2) = L^2 \neq 0$;
for $a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2) > L^2$, $\Li$ either lies unstably in the equatorial
plane or approaches it asymptotically from one side, while for $L=0$ and ($a=0$ or $|E|=\mu$),
$\Li$ lies at a constant value $\th=\th_0\in[0,\pi]$.
\item If $Q_{\rm min} < Q < 0$, $\Li$ oscillates between two turning
points strictly located in the Northern hemisphere ($0<\th<\pi/2$) or in
the Southern hemisphere ($\pi/2<\th<\pi$) for $L\neq 0$, while for $L=0$,
$\Li$ oscillates about the rotation axis, without encoutering the equatorial
plane, having a turning point at $\th_0$ such that $0<\th_0<\pi/2$
(motion in the Northern hemisphere) or $\pi/2<\th_0<\pi$
(motion in the Southern hemisphere).
\item If $Q = Q_{\rm min}$, $\Li$ lies stably at a constant value $\th=\th_0$,
with $\th_0 = 0$ or $\pi$ (the rotation axis) for $L=0$ and $0<\th_0< \pi/2$
or $\pi/2<\th_0<\pi$ for $L\neq 0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{greybox}

\begin{remark}
We could have deduced that $L=0$ is a necessary condition for a geodesic
to encounter the rotation axis without studying the potential $V(\th)$. Indeed,
by definition, $L = \w{\eta}\cdot\w{p}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_L})], with the Killing
vector $\w{\eta}$ being zero on the rotation axis, since the latter is
pointwise invariant under the action of the rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$.
Hence $L=0$ on the rotation axis. Since $L$ is constant along the geodesic,
the result follows immediately.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
That a vortical geodesic never intersects the equatorial plane has been
obtained by examining the various cases $Q<0$. This result can be derived
directly from the constraint $\Theta(\th)\geq 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_non_neg})],
by noticing the identity
$\Theta(\pi/2) = Q$, which follows immediately from Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}).
\end{remark}

\begin{example}[Schwarzschild geodesics]
It is instructive to apply the above results to $a=0$ and recover
the geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime studied in Chaps.~\ref{s:ges} and \ref{s:gis}.
There, spherical symmetry was used to select the coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ so that
the geodesic was confined to the hyperplane $\th=\pi/2$. Consequently there was
no $\th$-motion. Here, we keep the coordinates $(t,r,\th,\ph)$ fixed and do not
assume that they are adapted to the geodesic $\Li$ under consideration. So $\th$
may vary along $\Li$. In Schwarzschild spacetime, the Carter constant $Q$
is always non-negative [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Q_nonnegative})].\\
If $Q=0$, then for $L=0$, $\Li$ lies at a constant value of $\th$: this actually
corresponds to a purely radial geodesic. Indeed,
the total angular momentum measured in the asymptotic region is $\w{L}_{\rm tot} = 0$
in that case [set $Q=0$, $L=0$ and $a=0$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Q_Ltot2_L2})].
If $L\neq 0$, still with $Q=0$,
$\Li$ lies stably in the equatorial plane (this is the only possibility for $a=0$ among
the $Q=0$ cases listed above).\\
If $Q>0$, then $L=0$ is necessarily the subcase (ii) listed above:
$\Li$ crosses repeatedly the $z$-axis ($\th\in\{0,\pi\}$); this corresponds to the case where
the orbital plane contains the $z$-axis. All the angular momentum measured asymptotically
is then contained in $Q$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Q_Ltot2_L2})].
For $Q>0$ and $L\neq 0$, $\Li$ oscillates symmetrically about the equatorial
plane: this is the case where the orbital plane is inclined by an angle
$\iota\in(0,\pi/2)$
with respect to the equatorial plane; the $\th$-turning point of $\Li$ is then
$\th_0 = \pi/2-\iota$.
\end{example}


\subsection{$r$-motion} \label{s:gek:r-motion}

The $r$-part of geodesic motion is constrained by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:R_non_neg}):
$R(r) \geq 0$. Let us expand expression (\ref{e:gek:def_R_Q})
for the quartic polynomial $R(r)$ in powers of $r$:
\be \label{e:gek:R_r_powers}
    \encadre{ R(r) = (E^2 - \mu^2) r^4 + 2 m \mu^2 r^3
     + \left[ a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) - Q - L^2 \right] r^2
     + 2m\left[ Q + (L - a E)^2 \right] r - a^2 Q} .
\ee

\subsubsection{Geodesics with $|E|<\mu$} \label{s:gek:bound_geod}

For $r\to \pm\infty$ and $|E|\neq \mu$,
we have $R(r) \sim (E^2 - \mu^2) r^4$ and in
particular $\lim_{r\to\pm\infty} R(r) = + \infty$ for $|E|>\mu$
and $\lim_{r\to\pm\infty} R(r) = - \infty$ for $|E|<\mu$. In the latter case,
the constraint $R(r) \geq 0$ cannot be satisfied for large values
of $|r|$. A geodesic with $|E|<\mu$ is therefore located within a bounded
region in terms of the radial coordinate $r$. Moreover, we have seen in
Sec.~\ref{s:gek:th_motion} that for $|E|<\mu$, one has $Q\geq 0$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Q_nonnegative})]. Therefore $-a^2 Q \leq 0$.
It follows then that $r$ cannot be negative.
Indeed, we see
on expression~(\ref{e:gek:R_r_powers}) that for $|E|<\mu$ (which implies $\mu>0$ and $Q\geq 0$) and $r<0$,
\[
    R(r) = \underbrace{(E^2 - \mu^2) r^4}_{<0} + \underbrace{2 m \mu^2 r^3}_{<0}
     + \underbrace{\left[ a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2) - Q - L^2 \right] r^2}_{\leq 0}
     + \underbrace{2m\left[ Q + (L - a E)^2 \right] r}_{\leq 0}
     \underbrace{-a^2 Q}_{\leq 0} ,
\]
which contradicts $R(r)\geq 0$.
Hence we conclude:
\begin{greybox}
Any geodesic $\Li$ with $|E|<\mu$ is necessarily timelike ($\mu >0$),
has a non-negative Carter constant $Q$,
is confined to the region $r\geq 0$ of Kerr spacetime
and cannot reach arbitrary large values of $r$. $\Li$ is called a
\defin{geodesic with a bound orbit}\index{geodesic!with a bound orbit}\index{bound!orbit},
or in short, a \defin{bound geodesic}\index{bound!geodesic}.
\end{greybox}
\begin{remark} \label{r:gek:bound_geod}
That $\Li$
cannot reach the asymptotic region $r\to +\infty$ could have been
found directly from the definition of $E$ as the ``energy at infinity''
of the particle $\mathscr{P}$ having $\Li$ as worldline
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_E})]. Indeed, since $\Li$ is timelike, the 4-momentum
of $\mathscr{P}$ is $\w{p} = \mu \w{u}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:fra:p_m_u})], where
$\w{u}$ is the 4-velocity of $\mathscr{P}$, so that Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_E})
yields $E = - \mu\, \w{\xi}\cdot\w{u}$. Now, when $r\to +\infty$, $\w{\xi}$
tends to the 4-velocity of a static inertial observer.
If $\Li$ could reach the asymptotic region,
the scalar
product of the two 4-velocities $\w{\xi}$ and
$\w{u}$ would be necessarily lower or equal to $-1$, or equivalently
$\Gamma := - \w{\xi}\cdot\w{u} \geq 1$ (the proof lies in expression
(\ref{e:fra:Gam_V2}) of $\Gamma$ with $0\leq \w{V}\cdot\w{V} < 1$), so that
we would have $E \geq \mu$, which contradicts $|E|<\mu$.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Geodesics with $|E|=\mu$}

Contrary to the case $|E|<\mu$, a geodesic with $|E|=\mu$ can be null,
provided it has $E=0$
(cf. Example~\ref{x:gek:null_generator_hor} on page~\pageref{x:gek:null_generator_hor}).
We have
\begin{greybox}
Any geodesic with $|E|=\mu$ has $Q\geq 0$ and is necessarily confined
to the region $r\geq 0$ of Kerr spacetime.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
$Q\geq 0$ follows directly from the criteria $|E| \leq \sqrt{\mu^2 + {L^2}/{a^2}}$
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Q_nonnegative})],
which is evidently fulfilled for $|E|=\mu$.
Furthermore, for $|E|=\mu$, expression (\ref{e:gek:R_r_powers}) for $R(r)$
simplifies to
\[
    R(r) =  2 m \mu^2 r^3 - (Q + L^2) r^2 + 2m  \left[Q + (L-aE)^2 \right] r - a^2 Q .
\]
For $r<0$, all the four terms in the above sum are $\leq 0$.
If $\Li$ is timelike, then $\mu\neq 0$ and the first term is $<0$, so that
$r<0 \Longrightarrow R(r) < 0$, which violates the constraint
$R(r) \geq 0$. Let us now assume that $\Li$ is null.
We have then $\mu=0$ and $E=0$, so that
\[
    R(r) = - (Q + L^2) r^2 + 2m  (Q + L^2) r -a^2 Q = (Q+L^2) r ( 2m - r) -a^2 Q.
\]
If $Q + L^2 \neq 0$, $R(r)$ is a quadratic polynomial that is
either negative everywhere or negative outside the interval $[r_1, r_2]$,
when the two roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ of $R(r)$ are reals. In the latter case, we deduce
from the signs of the coefficients of $R(r)$ that $r_1+r_2 > 0$ and $r_1 r_2 \geq 0$,
so that $r_1 \geq 0$ and $r_2 \geq 0$. This implies that $R(r) < 0$ for
$r<0$, which is not permitted.
If $Q + L^2 = 0$, the property $Q\geq 0$ implies $Q=0$ and $L = 0$.
The Carter constant $\mathscr{K}$ is then zero as well, since
$\mathscr{K} = Q + (L - a E)^2$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_Q})].
Then by the result (\ref{e:gek:all_const_zero}), $\Li$ is a null geodesic
generator of either the event horizon $\Hor$, which is located at $r=r_+$,
or the inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$, which is located at $r=r_-$.
Since both $r_+$ and $r_-$ are positive
[Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:order_r_pm})], we cannot have $r<0$ in this case either.
\end{proof}

A timelike geodesic $\Li$ with $E=\mu$ can reach the asymptotic region
$r\to +\infty$. It has then a Lorentz factor
with respect to the asymptotic static observer of 4-velocity $\w{\xi}$
equal to one (cf. Remark~\ref{r:gek:bound_geod} above), which implies that
$\w{p}$ is collinear to $\w{\xi}$. In that sense, $\Li$
is asymptotically ``at rest''. Such a geodesic is called
\defin{marginally bound}\index{marginally!bound!orbit}\index{orbit!marginally bound --}\index{marginally!bound!geodesic}.


On the opposite, a null geodesic with $E=\mu (=0)$
cannot reach the asymptotic region
$r\to +\infty$. Actually, it cannot even exist outside the ergoregion,
by virtue of the property (\ref{e:gek:E_positive}).
\begin{example}
The null geodesics generating the horizons $\Hor$ and $\Hor_{\rm in}$
considered in
Example~\ref{x:gek:null_generator_hor} on page~\pageref{x:gek:null_generator_hor}
have $E=0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:generator_hor_E_L_zero})]
and are indeed fully located inside the ergoregion $\mathscr{G}$,
since $\Hor\subset\mathscr{G}$ and $\Hor_{\rm in}\subset\mathscr{G}$
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:ker:ergo_a90}).
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Geodesics with $|E|>\mu$}

An immediate corollary of the properties obtained for $|E|<\mu$ and $|E|=\mu$
is
\begin{greybox}
Only geodesics with $|E| > \mu$ may have some part in the region $r<0$ of Kerr spacetime, $\M_-$:
\be \label{e:ker:neg_r_large_E}
    \Li \cap \M_- \neq \varnothing \Longrightarrow |E| > \mu .
\ee
\end{greybox}

\subsection{Geodesics reaching or emanating from the ring singularity}

In the Schwarzschild spacetime, any causal geodesic that enters into the black
hole region inevitably terminates at the curvature singularity $r=0$, as it
is clear on the Kruskal or Carter-Penrose diagrams constructed in Chap.~\ref{s:max}.
For the Kerr spacetime with $a\neq 0$, we are going to see that, on the contrary,
most causal geodesics in the black hole region \emph{avoid} the curvature
singularity. In all this section, we assume $a\neq 0$, so that the
curvature singularity is the ring singularity\index{ring!singularity} $\ring$
discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:singularities}.

Formally, $\ring$ is not
part of the Kerr spacetime $\M$ but of the larger manifold $\R^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$
[cf. the construction (\ref{e:ker:def_M_Kerr_spacetime})]. It is located
at $\rho^2 = 0$, i.e. at $r=0$ and
$\th=\pi/2$. We shall say that a
geodesic $\Li$ of affine parameter $\lambda$ (oriented towards to the future)
\defin{approaches the ring singularity}\index{approach the singularity}
if $\Li$ has both
$r(\lambda)\to 0$ and $\th(\lambda) \to \pi/2$ as $\lambda\to\lambda_*$, with
$\lambda_*$ being finite or infinite. If $\lambda_*$ is finite, we shall say
that $\Li$ \defin{hits the ring singulary}\index{hit the singularity}
for $\lambda\to\lambda_*^-$ and
\defin{emanates from the ring singularity}\index{emanate from the singularity}
for $\lambda\to\lambda_*^+$. If $\lambda_*=\pm\infty$, we shall say
that $\Li$ \defin{asymptotically approaches the ring singularity}\index{asymptotically!
approach the singularity}.

A first key result is
\begin{greybox}
A null or timelike geodesic $\Li$ that approaches the ring singularity has
a vanishing Carter constant $Q$.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
From Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:R_r_powers}) and (\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}), we have
\[
 \lim_{r\to 0} R(r) = - a^2 Q \quad\mbox{and}\quad
 \lim_{\th\to \pi/2} \Theta(\th) = Q .
\]
The constraints $R(r) \geq 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:R_non_neg})]
and $\Theta(\th)\geq 0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_non_neg})] imply then respectively
$Q \leq 0$ and $Q\geq 0$, from which we get $Q=0$.
\end{proof}

The above property can be refined\footnote{This is a refinement because not all
geodesics with $Q=0$ lie in the equatorial plane. For instance the
null geodesic generators of the event horizon $\Hor$ have $Q=0$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:all_const_zero})]
but those with $\th\neq \pi/2$ lie outside the equatorial plane.}:
\begin{greybox}
A null or timelike geodesic cannot approach the ring singularity unless it lies
entirely in the equatorial plane.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
Let $\Li$ be a causal geodesic that approaches $\ring$. From the previous result,
$\Li$ has $Q=0$. Reviewing the subcases $Q=0$ among all the cases considered in
Sec.~\ref{s:gek:th_motion}, we see that $\Li$ can approach $\th=\pi/2$ iff
(i) $\Li$ has
$|E|\leq \sqrt{\mu^2 + L^2/a^2}$ and lies stably in the equatorial plane
or (ii) $\Li$ has $|E| > \sqrt{\mu^2 + L^2/a^2}$ and approaches asymptotically
$\th=\pi/2$ as the Mino parameter $\lambda'$ tends to $\pm\infty$.
Let us show that (ii) is not compatible with $r\to 0$.
For $Q=0$, expression~(\ref{e:gek:R_r_powers}) for $R(r)$ reduces to
\[
 R(r) = r \left[ (E^2 - \mu^2) r^3 + 2 m \mu^2 r^2
     + \left( a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) - L^2 \right) r
     + 2m (L - a E)^2 \right] ,
\]
with the constant term inside the square brackets $2m(L - a E)^2 \neq 0$,
since $L=a E$ is not compatible with $|E| > \sqrt{\mu^2 + L^2/a^2}$. It
follows that $r=0$ is a simple root of $R(r)$. If $\Li$ would reach both
$r=0$ and $\th=\pi/2$ when $\lambda$ tends to some value $\lambda_*$,
then Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:integr_Mino}) would yield
\be \label{e:gek:dashint_r_theta}
    \lambda'_* - \lambda'_0 = \dashint_{r_0}^0 \frac{\eps_r \, \D r}{\sqrt{R(r)}}
    = \dashint_{\th_0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\eps_\th \, \D \th}{\sqrt{\Theta(\th)}} ,
\ee
where $\lambda'_*$ is the Mino parameter corresponding to $\lambda_*$. Note that
$\lambda'_*$ may be infinite even if $\lambda_*$ is finite, due to the
relation (\ref{e:gek:def_Mino_time}) with $\rho^2\to 0$ when $\lambda\to\lambda_*$.
Since $r=0$ is a simple root of $R(r)$, the integral on $r$ has a finite value.
Now, for $Q=0$, expression (\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}) for $\Theta$ reduces to
\[
    \Theta(\th) = \cos^2\th \left[ a^2 (E^2 - \mu^2)
    - \frac{L^2}{\sin^2\th} \right] .
\]
The $\cos^2\th$ term, which behaves as $(\th - \pi/2)^2$ for $\th$ near $\pi/2$,
makes the integral on $\th$ in
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:dashint_r_theta}) divergent, which is incompatible with the
finite value of the integral on $r$ in the left-hand side. Hence only (i) is possible, which completes
the proof.
\end{proof}

The above result has been obtained for a generic approach to the ring singularity,
i.e. for a geodesic $\Li$ that hits $\ring$, emanates from $\ring$ or
asymptotically approach $\Li$ in the future or the past. If we apply it to
null geodesics (light rays) emanating from $\ring$, we conclude that an intrepid observer
diving into the black hole would not see the ring singularity at all, except when
he crosses the equatorial plane. At this instant, the singularity would appear
to him as a 1-dimensional segment, and the image would disappear as soon as the observer
leaves the equatorial plane. In particular, the observer will never see a ring-like image.


%\subsection{Moving to the negative $r$ side}


\section{Timelike geodesics}

\subsection{Parametrization}

Whenever the geodesic $\Li$ is timelike, it is relevant to
rescale everything by the mass $\mu$ of the particle $\mathscr{P}$ whose worldline is $\Li$.
In particular, as in the Schwarzschild case treated in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:timelike},
let us parametrize $\Li$ by the proper time $\tau$, which is the affine parameter
related to the affine parameter $\lambda$ associated to the 4-momentum $\w{p}$
by
\be \label{e:gek:tau_mu_lamb}
    \tau = \mu \lambda
\ee
and let us introduce the
\defin{specific conserved energy}\index{specific!conserved!energy} $\veps$,
\defin{specific conserved angular momentum}\index{specific!conserved!angular momuntum}
$\ell$ ,
and \defin{reduced Carter constant}\index{reduced!Carter constant}\index{Carter!constant!reduced --} $q$:
\be \label{e:gek:def_eps_ell_mQ}
  \encadre{ \veps := \frac{E}{\mu}}, \qquad
  \encadre{ \ell :=  \frac{L}{\mu}} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
  \encadre{ q := \frac{Q}{\mu^2}} .
\ee
We shall refer to $\veps$, $\ell$ and $q$ as the
\defin{reduced integrals of motion}\index{reduced!integral of motion}\index{integral!of motion!reduced --}
of the geodesic $\Li$. Note that in geometrized units ($c=G=1$), $\veps$ is
dimensionless, $\ell$ has the dimension of a length and $q$ that of a squared length.

The first-order equations of motion (\ref{e:gek:eom_Mino}) can be rewritten in terms of the above quantities:
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:timelike_system}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{ \derd{t}{\tau'} = a\ell + T_1(r) + T_2(\th) } \label{e:gek:dtdmino_timelike}\\
& \encadre{  \left( \derd{r}{\tau'} \right)^2 - \mathcal{R}(r) = 0 } \label{e:gek:r_eff_pot_timelike}\\
& \encadre{ \left( \derd{\theta}{\tau'} \right)^2 - \tilde{\Theta}(\th) = 0 } \label{e:gek:th_eff_pot_timelike}\\
& \encadre{ \derd{\ph}{\tau'}  = - a \veps + \Phi_1(r) + \Phi_2(\th) } \label{e:gek:dphdmino_timelike}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\tau'$ is related to the Mino parameter $\lambda'$ by
\be
   \tau' = \mu \lambda'
\ee
and
\be
    T_1(r) := \frac{r^2 + a^2}{r^2 - 2 m r + a^2} [\veps (r^2 + a^2)  - a \ell]
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    T_2(\th) := - a^2 \veps \sin^2\th,
\ee
\be
    \Phi_1(r) := \frac{a}{r^2 - 2 m r + a^2}\left[\veps (r^2 + a^2) - a \ell \right]
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \Phi_2(\th) := \frac{\ell}{\sin^2\th} ,
\ee
\be \label{e:gek:R_timelike}
  \encadre{  \mathcal{R}(r) := (\veps^2 - 1) r^4 + 2 m r^3
    + \left[a^2 (\veps^2 - 1) - q -  \ell^2\right] r^2
    + 2m\left[ q + (\ell -a \veps)^2 \right] r  - a^2  q },
\ee
\be \label{e:gek:Theta_timelike}
  \encadre{ \tilde\Theta(\th) := q + \cos^2\th \left[ a^2 (\veps^2 - 1)
    - \frac{\ell^2}{\sin^2\th} \right] } .
\ee
Note that $\mathcal{R}(r) = R(r) / \mu^2$, $\tilde\Theta(\th) := \Theta(\th) / \mu^2$
and that expressions~(\ref{e:gek:R_timelike}) and (\ref{e:gek:Theta_timelike})
follow respectively from Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:R_r_powers}) and (\ref{e:gek:Theta_Q}).

Using Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:tau_mu_lamb}) and (\ref{e:gek:def_Mino_time}), we can
relate $\tau'$ to the proper time $\tau$:
\be \label{e:gek:Mino_time_tau}
   \encadre{ \D\tau' = \frac{\D\tau}{\rho^2}
     = \frac{\D\tau}{r(\tau)^2 + a^2 \cos^2 \th(\tau)} } .
\ee
We shall call $\tau'$ \defin{Mino time}\index{Mino!time}\index{time!Mino --}
along the geodesic $\Li$.
\begin{remark}
Despite its name, the Mino time has not the dimension of a time, but rather
that of a time inverse or length inverse (in the units $G=c=1$ that we
are using).
\end{remark}


\subsection{Bound orbits}

We consider here a timelike geodesic $\Li$ with $|E|< \mu$, or equivalently
\be \label{e:gek:veps_lt_one}
    |\veps| < 1 .
\ee
As shown in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:r-motion}, such a geodesic has necessarily a positive
Carter constant:
\be
    q >0
\ee
and is located in a radialy bounded part of the $r\geq 0$ region of Kerr spacetime.

Equation~(\ref{e:gek:r_eff_pot_timelike}) can be viewed as the first-integral of
a 1-dimensional motion in the effective potential $U(r) := - \mathcal{R}(r)$,
with a vanishing ``total energy'' --- the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:r_eff_pot_timelike}).
The motion is thus possible wherever $U(r) \leq 0$ or, equivalently, wherever
$\mathcal{R}(r) \geq 0$, which is nothing but the constraint (\ref{e:gek:R_non_neg}).
Equation~(\ref{e:gek:veps_lt_one})
implies that the coefficient of $r^4$ in formula
(\ref{e:gek:R_timelike}) for $\mathcal{R}(r)$ is negative. It follows then that
$\lim_{r\to\pm\infty} U(r) = +\infty$ and the segments with $U(r) \leq 0$
are located between two roots of $\mathcal{R}(r)$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gek:R_potential}).
Let us denote the lower of these two roots by $r_{\rm p}$, for \defin{periastron}\index{periastron}, and the larger one by $r_{\rm a}$, for \defin{apoastron}\index{apoastron}.
The periastron and apoastron are of course \emph{$r$-turning points} of the geodesic,
as defined in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:turning_points}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{gek_R_potential.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:gek:R_potential} \footnotesize
Effective potential $-\mathcal{R}(r)$ corresponding to $a=0.998\, m$,
$\veps=0.9$, $\ell=2 m$ and $q=1.3\, m^2$. The black vertical line
marks the black hole horizon at $r=r_+\simeq 1.063\, m$.
Note that the polynomial $-\mathcal{R}(r)$
has four real roots, one of them being very close to, but distinct from, $r_+$.
The two largest roots give the periastron and apoastron of the bound orbit
with the above values of $(\veps,\ell,q)$; they
are respectively $r_p \simeq 2.175\, m$ and
$r_a \simeq 6.853\, m$.
\textsl{[Figure generated by the notebook \ref{s:sam:Kerr_geod_plots}]}
}
\end{figure}

It is clear that the motion in the potential well $U(r) = - \mathcal{R}(r)$
as governed by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:r_eff_pot_timelike})
(cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gek:R_potential}) is periodic:
\be
    \forall n\in\mathbb{Z},\quad r(\tau' + n \Lambda_r) = r(\tau') ,
\ee
the period
$\Lambda_r$ being the Mino time $\Delta\tau'$ spent to perform a round-trip
between $r_{\rm p}$ and $r_{\rm a}$. By rewriting Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:r_eff_pot_timelike})
as $\D\tau' = \pm \D r / \sqrt{\mathcal{R}(r)}$, we get
\be \label{e:gek:Lambda_r}
    \Lambda_r = 2 \int_{r_{\rm p}}^{r_{\rm a}} \frac{\D r}{\sqrt{\mathcal{R}(r)}} .
\ee
Since $\mathcal{R}(r)$ is a polynomial of degree 4 [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:R_timelike})],
the integral in the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Lambda_r}) can
be evaluated by means of elliptic integrals. We shall not give the detail
here, refering the interested reader to the article~\cite{FujitH09}.

Regarding the $\th$-motion, we are in the case $a^2(E^2 - \mu^2) < L^2$
considered in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:th_motion}, since for bound geodesics $E^2 - \mu^2 < 0$.
The effective $\th$-potential $V(\th) = Q - \Theta(\th)$ has then the shape shown in
the left panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0} for $\ell=0$ and in the left panel
of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_non0} for $\ell\neq 0$.
We can then distinguish two types of orbits:
\begin{itemize}
\item \defin{polar orbit}: $\Li$ crosses the rotational axis an infinite number
of times; this occurs iff $\ell=0$ and $q > a^2 ( 1-\veps^2)$;
\item \defin{non-polar orbit}: $\Li$ never crosses the rotational axis; it
rather oscillates symmetrically about the equatorial plane between
two $\th$-turning points $\th_{\rm min} \in (0,\pi /2)$ and $\pi-\th_{\rm min}$.
Such orbits occur for either
$\ell\not=0$ or $\ell=0$ and $q < a^2 ( 1-\veps^2)$.
\end{itemize}
Stricly speaking, there is also the exceptional case $\ell=0$ and
$q = a^2 (1 -\veps^2)$, for which the rotation axis is reached only
asymptotically (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:asymptotic_values} and the grey dashed curve
in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:th_pot_L_0}).

In the following, we focus on non-polar orbits.
The angle $\th_{\rm min}$ is a zero of $\tilde{\Theta}(\th)$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:turning_points}). Given expression (\ref{e:gek:Theta_timelike}) of $\tilde{\Theta}(\th)$,
we get
\[
    a^2 (1-\veps^2) \sin^4\th_{\rm min}
    + \left[ \ell^2 + q - a^2 (1-\veps^2) \right] \sin^2\th_{\rm min} - \ell^2 = 0 .
\]
Solving this quadratic equation in $\sin^2\th_{\rm min}$ yields
\be \label{e:gek:th_min_arcsin}
    \th_{\rm min} = \arcsin\sqrt{\frac{a^2(1 - \veps^2) - \ell^2 - q
        + \sqrt{\left[ \ell^2 + q - a^2 (1-\veps^2) \right]^2 + 4 \ell^2 a^2 (1-\veps^2)}}{2 a^2 (1-\veps^2)} }.
\ee

From the viewpoint of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_pot_timelike}) above,
non-polar orbits have a periodic $\th$-motion in the potential well $-\tilde{\Theta}(\th)$:
\be
    \forall n\in\mathbb{Z},\quad \th(\tau' + n \Lambda_\th) = \th(\tau') .
\ee
The period
$\Lambda_\theta$ is the Mino time $\Delta\tau'$ spent in a round-trip
between $\theta_{\rm min}$ and $\pi-\theta_{\rm min}$.
By rewriting Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_pot_timelike})
as $\D\tau' = \pm \D \th / \sqrt{\tilde\Theta(\th)}$, we get
\be
    \Lambda_\th = 2 \int_{\th_{\rm min}}^{\pi-\th_{\rm min}}
              \frac{\D \th}{\sqrt{\tilde\Theta(\th)}}
              = 4 \int_{\th_{\rm min}}^{\pi/2}
                  \frac{\D \th}{\sqrt{\tilde\Theta(\th)}} ,
\ee
where the last equality results from the symmetry of $\tilde\Theta(\th)$
with respect to $\pi/2$.
One naturally associates to the periods $\Lambda_r$ and $\Lambda_\th$
the \defin{Mino angular frequencies}\index{Mino!angular frequency}\index{angular!frequency!Mino --}:
\be
    \Upsilon_r := \frac{2\pi}{\Lambda_r} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \Upsilon_\th := \frac{2\pi}{\Lambda_\th} .
\ee

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gek_torus.pdf}}
\caption[]{\label{f:gek:torus} \footnotesize
Meridional section of the torus occupied by a bound timelike geodesic. The dot-dashed line
is the rotation axis and the solid line marks the equatorial plane.
}
\end{figure}

For non-polar orbits, the motion is restricted by
\be
 \encadre{r_{\rm p}\leq r \leq r_{\rm a}} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
 \encadre{\th_{\rm min} \leq \th \leq \pi - \th_{\rm min}}.
\ee
This means that in terms of the Cartesian Boyer-Lindquist coordinates (\ref{e:gek:Cartesian_BL}), the
geodesic is confined inside a torus (cf. Fig.~\ref{f:gek:torus}), which is
symmetric about the equatorial plane. Moreover, if the two frequencies
$\Upsilon_r$ and $\Upsilon_\th$ are not commensurable, i.e. if
$\Upsilon_\th / \Upsilon_r \not\in\mathbb{Q}$, the geodesic fills the torus.
Examples of orbits with $\Upsilon_\th / \Upsilon_r \in\mathbb{Q}$, i.e.
orbits with a closed trajectory in the $(r,\th)$ plane, can be
found in Ref.~\cite{GrossLP12}.

As an illustration, Figs.~\ref{f:gek:timelike_xyz}--\ref{f:gek:timelike_txy}
show a bound timelike geodesic $\Li$ of reduced integrals of motion
$\veps=0.9$, $\ell=2 m$ and $q=1.3\, m^2$
orbiting around a Kerr black hole with $a=0.998\, m$.
It has $r_p \simeq 2.175\, m$,
$r_a \simeq 6.853\, m$ and $\th_{\rm min} \simeq 1.060\, {\rm rad} \simeq 60.75^\circ$.
The effective radial potential
$-\mathcal{R}(r)$ of this geodesic is the one depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:R_potential}.
Figures~\ref{f:gek:timelike_xyz}--\ref{f:gek:timelike_txy} show actually the
segment $0\leq \tau \leq 600 \, m$ of $\Li$,
starting at the point of Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
$(0, (r_{\rm p} + r_{\rm a})/2, \pi/2, 0)$.
That $\th(\tau)$ lies in the interval
$[\th_{\rm min}, \pi-\th_{\rm min}] \sim [60^\circ, 120^\circ]$ appears clearly in the
right panel of Fig.~\ref{f:gek:timelike_plane}. On Figs.~\ref{f:gek:timelike_plane}
(left panel) and \ref{f:gek:timelike_txy}, we notice a generic feature
of eccentric orbits in the Kerr metric, known as
\defin{zoom-whirl}\index{zoom-whirl}\footnote{According to Ref.~\cite{GlampK02},
the name ``zoom-whirl'' has been forged by Curt Cutler and Eric Poisson and
may have been suggested by Kip Thorne.}:
the particle falls
from its apoastron to the central region (``zoom in'') and performs some
quasi-circular revolutions at close distance to the black hole (it ``whirls''), reaching
the periastron, and finally goes back to the apoastron. The zoom-whirl behaviour
exists as well for eccentric orbits in Schwarschild spacetime (cf. right panel
of Fig.~\ref{f:ges:orbit_e967_990_l42}), but is less
pronounced, i.e. the number of whirls is smaller (only one in
Fig.~\ref{f:ges:orbit_e967_990_l42}).


Let us now consider the evolution of the coordinates $t$ and $\ph$ along the
geodesic, as governed
by Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdmino_timelike}) and (\ref{e:gek:dphdmino_timelike}).
Since $r$ and $\th$ are periodic functions of $\tau'$, so are the terms
$T_1(r)$, $T_2(\th)$, $\Phi_1(r)$ and $\Phi_2(\th)$ that appear in the right-hand side
of Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdmino_timelike}) and (\ref{e:gek:dphdmino_timelike}). We can thus expand them in Fourier series:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  &  T_1(r) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} \hat{T}_{1k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_r \, \tau'} = \langle T_1(r) \rangle + \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left( \hat{T}_{1k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_r \, \tau'} + \mathrm{c.c.} \right) \\
  &  T_2(\th) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} \hat{T}_{2k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_\th \, \tau'} = \langle T_2(\th) \rangle + \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left( \hat{T}_{2k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_\th \, \tau'} + \mathrm{c.c.} \right) \\
  &  \Phi_1(r) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} \hat{\Phi}_{1k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_r \, \tau'} = \langle \Phi_1(r) \rangle + \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left( \hat{\Phi}_{1k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_r \, \tau'} + \mathrm{c.c.} \right) \\
  &  \Phi_2(\th) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} \hat{\Phi}_{2k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_\th \, \tau'} = \langle \Phi_2(\th) \rangle + \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left( \hat{\Phi}_{2k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_\th \, \tau'} + \mathrm{c.c.} \right) ,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where ``c.c.`` stands for \emph{complex conjugate} and $\langle T_1(r) \rangle = \hat{T}_{10}$, $\langle T_2(\th) \rangle = \hat{T}_{20}$,
$\langle \Phi_1(r) \rangle = \hat{\Phi}_{10}$ and $\langle \Phi_2(\th) \rangle = \hat{\Phi}_{20}$
are the mean values of the functions $T_1(r(\tau'))$,
$T_2(\th(\tau'))$, $\Phi_1(r(\tau'))$ and $\Phi_2(\th(\tau'))$ over one period:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    & \langle T_1(r) \rangle = \frac{1}{\Lambda_r} \int_{0}^{\Lambda_r}
        T_1(r(\tau'))\, \D \tau'
        = \frac{2}{\Lambda_r} \int_{r_{\rm p}}^{r_{\rm a}} \frac{T_1(r)}{\sqrt{R(r)}}\, \D r \\
    & \langle T_2(\th) \rangle = \frac{1}{\Lambda_\th} \int_{0}^{\Lambda_\th}
        T_2(\th(\tau'))\, \D \tau'
        = \frac{4}{\Lambda_\th} \int_{\th_{\rm min}}^{\pi/2}
            \frac{T_2(\th)}{\sqrt{\tilde\Theta(\th)}}\, \D \th ,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with similar formulas for $\langle \Phi_1(r) \rangle$ and $\langle \Phi_2(\th) \rangle$.

We may then rewrite Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:dtdmino_timelike}) and (\ref{e:gek:dphdmino_timelike})
as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
 & \derd{t}{\tau'} = \Gamma + \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left( \hat{T}_{1k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_r \, \tau'} + \mathrm{c.c.} \right)

 & \derd{\ph}{\tau'} = \Upsilon_\ph + \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left( \hat{\Phi}_{1k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_r \, \tau'} + \mathrm{c.c.} \right)
 + \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} \left( \hat{\Phi}_{2k} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \Upsilon_\th \, \tau'} + \mathrm{c.c.} \right) ,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with
\be
    \Gamma := a\ell + \langle T_1(r) \rangle + \langle T_2(\th) \rangle ,
\ee
and
\be
    \Upsilon_\ph :=  - a \veps + \langle \Phi_1(r) \rangle + \langle \Phi_2(\th) \rangle .
\ee
$\Gamma$ and $\Upsilon_\ph$ represent the constant (or average) parts in
respectively $\D t/\D\tau'$ and $\D \ph / \D\tau'$, while the oscillatory parts
are the terms in the sums over $k\geq 1$.
Since $\Gamma$ is the average value of $\D t/\D\tau'$,
we can define the
\defin{average angular frequencies with respect to Boyer-Lindquist time}\index{average!angular frequency}
by \cite{DrascH04,FujitH09}
\be
    \Omega_r := \frac{\Upsilon_r}{\Gamma},\qquad
    \Omega_\th := \frac{\Upsilon_\th}{\Gamma}, \qquad
    \Omega_\ph := \frac{\Upsilon_\ph}{\Gamma} .
\ee
It worth to stress the following: the motion of a generic bound timelike
geodesic in the Kerr spacetime is periodic in $r$ and $\th$
only in terms of the Mino time $\tau'$, the corresponding angular frequencies
being $\Upsilon_r$ and $\Upsilon_\th$. In terms of the Boyer-Lindquist time
$t$, the motion in $r$ or $\th$ is not periodic. Accordingly, the ``average''
frequencies $\Omega_r$ and $\Omega_\th$ defined above are not true
frequencies like $\Upsilon_r$ or $\Upsilon_\th$.
Regarding the motion in $\ph$,
it is not periodic, neither in terms of the Mino time, nor in terms
of the Boyer-Lindquist time, so that both $\Upsilon_\ph$ and $\Omega_\ph$
are average frequencies.

\subsubsection{Quasi-Keplerian parametrization}

Given a bound timelike geodesic $\Li$ of Kerr spacetime, one may define
its \defin{eccentricity}\index{eccentricity} $e$ and (dimensionless)
\defin{semilatus rectum} $p$ by means of Keplerian-like formulas \cite{Schmi02,DrascH06,SteinW20}:
\be \label{e:gek:rp_ra_p_e}
    r_{\rm p} =: \frac{p m}{1 + e} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    r_{\rm a} =: \frac{p m}{1 - e} ,
\ee
or equivalently
\be \label{e:gek:p_e_ra_rp}
    p = \frac{2 r_{\rm a} r_{\rm p}}{m (r_{\rm a} + r_{\rm p})}
    \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    e = \frac{r_{\rm a} - r_{\rm p}}{r_{\rm a} + r_{\rm p}} .
\ee
One may also introduce the \defin{inclination angle} $\th_{\rm inc}$ by
\be \label{e:gek:def_th_inc}
    \th_{\rm inc} := \frac{\pi}{2} - (\operatorname{sgn}\ell) \th_{\rm min} .
\ee
The sign of $\ell$ appears in this formula to enforce $\th_{\rm inc} \in [0, \pi/2]$
for prograde orbits ($\ell > 0$) and $\th_{rm inc} \in [\pi/2, \pi]$ for retrograde
orbits ($\ell < 0$).

Instead of $(\veps,\ell,q)$, a bound timelike geodesic
can be parametrized\footnote{Some authors use $x:=\cos\th_{\rm inc}$
instead of $\th_{\rm inc}$ \cite{SteinW20}.}
by $(p, e, \th_{\rm inc})$. Actually, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between $(\veps,\ell,q)$ and $(p, e, \th_{\rm inc})$:
it is clear from formulas (\ref{e:gek:p_e_ra_rp}) and (\ref{e:gek:p_e_ra_rp})
that $(p, e, \th_{\rm inc})$ are functions of $(\veps,\ell,q)$, because
(i) $r_{\rm a}$ and $r_{\rm p}$ are some roots of the quartic polynomial
$\mathcal{R}(r)$, whose coefficients are functions of $(\veps,\ell,q)$ only
(at fixed Kerr parameters $(m, a)$) [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:R_timelike})] and
(ii) $\th_{\rm min}$ in the right-hand side of expression~(\ref{e:gek:def_th_inc}) for
$\th_{\rm inc}$ is the function of $(\veps,\ell,q)$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_min_arcsin}).
Conversely, to express $(\veps,\ell,q)$ in terms of $(p, e, \th_{\rm inc})$,
one shall write
\[
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
        \mathcal{R}(r_{\rm p}) = 0 \\
        \mathcal{R}(r_{\rm a}) = 0 \\
        \tilde{\Theta}(\th_{\rm min}) = 0 ,
        \end{array} \right.
\]
where $r_{\rm p}$ and $r_{\rm a}$ are the functions of $(e,p)$ given
by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:rp_ra_p_e}) and $\th_{\rm min}$ is the function
of $\th_{\rm inc}$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_th_inc}). The above system
is then a system of 3 equations for the 3 unknowns $(\veps,\ell,q)$; see
Appendix~B of Ref.~\cite{Schmi02} or Appendix~A of Ref.~\cite{DrascH06} for details.

\begin{example}
The geodesic $\Li$ depicted in Figs.~\ref{f:gek:timelike_xyz}--\ref{f:gek:timelike_txy}
has $\veps=0.9$, $\ell=2 m$ and $q=1.3\, m^2$, from which we get
$r_p = 2.175\, m$,
$r_a = 6.853\, m$ and $\th_{\rm min} = 1.060\, {\rm rad} = 60.75^\circ$.
Then Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:p_e_ra_rp}) and (\ref{e:gek:def_th_inc}) yield
$p=3.302$, $e=0.518$ and $\th_{\rm inc} = 29.26^\circ$.
\end{example}

The parametrization $(p, e, \th_{\rm inc})$ allows one to introduce
along the geodesic $\Li$ the radial phase angle $\psi(\tau)$ and the
meridional phase angle $\chi(\tau)$ as monotically increasing functions
of $\tau$ such that
\be
    r(\tau) =: \frac{p m}{1 + e\cos\psi(\tau)} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
    \th(\tau) =: \arccos\left( \cos\th_{\rm min} \, \cos\chi(\tau) \right) .
\ee
For numerical integration, $\psi(\tau)$ and $\chi(\tau)$ are preferred
to $r(\tau)$ and $\th(\tau)$ since the latter are tricky at the
turning points, where $\D r/\D\tau$ and $\D\th/\D\tau$ vanish and change sign
\cite{DrascH04}.

\section{Circular timelike orbits in the equatorial plane}

\subsection{Equations of motion in the equatorial plane}

Let us focus on timelike geodesics confined to the equatorial plane:
$\th=\pi/2$. They thus have $\D\th/\D\tau' = 0$ and Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:th_eff_pot_timelike})
leads to $\tilde{\Theta}(\th) = 0$. Given expression~(\ref{e:gek:Theta_timelike}) for $\tilde{\Theta}(\th)$, this
implies
\be
    q = 0 .
\ee
\begin{remark}
The above result follows as well from the analysis of the $\th$-motion performed
in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:th_motion} and according to which the only possibility
for a motion confined to the equatorial plane is $Q=0$, be the geodesic timelike or null.
The converse is not true: there exist (timelike or null) geodesics with $Q=0$ outside the equatorial
plane; they are asymptotically approaching the equatorial from one side, except for
the exceptional case $L=0$ and $a^2 E^2 = a^2 \mu^2$, for which they are moving with
a constant value of $\th$ (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:th_motion}).
\end{remark}

When $\th=\pi/2$, we have $\sin^2\th=1$, $\rho^2 = r^2$ and $\D\tau' = r^{-2}\D\tau$
[cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Mino_time_tau})], so that the system
(\ref{e:gek:timelike_system}) reduces to
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:equat_time_system}
\begin{align}
& \encadre{ \frac{\D t}{\D\tau} = \frac{1}{r^2 - 2 m r + a^2} \left[
    \veps(r^2 + a^2) + \frac{2 a m}{r} (a\veps - \ell) \right] } \label{e:gek:timel_dtdtau} \\
& \encadre{ \left( \frac{\D r}{\D \tau} \right) ^2 + \mathcal{V}(r) = 0 }\label{e:gek:timel_drdtau} \\
& \encadre{ \frac{\D\ph}{\D\tau} = \frac{1}{r^2 - 2 m r + a^2} \left[
    \ell \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right)
    + \frac{2 am \veps}{r} \right] },  \label{e:gek:timel_dphdtau}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with
\be \label{e:gek:def_V_time_equat}
   \encadre{ \mathcal{V}(r) := 1 - \veps^2 - \frac{2m}{r} + \frac{\ell^2 + a^2(1-\veps^2)}{r^2}
    - \frac{2m(\ell - a\veps)^2}{r^3} }.
\ee
Note that $\mathcal{V}(r) = - \mathcal{R}(r)/r^4 = - R(r) / (\mu^2 r^4)$ [cf. Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:R_timelike}) and (\ref{e:gek:R_r_powers})].
\begin{remark}
At the Schwarzschild limit ($a=0$) we recover the differential equations of Chap.~\ref{s:ges},
namely Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:timel_dtdtau}) reduces to Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:Dt_Dtau}),
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:timel_drdtau}) to Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:1d_motion_timelike}) and
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:timel_dphdtau}) to Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:Dph_Dtau}). In particular
we have $\mathcal{V}(r) = 1 - \veps^2 + 2 V_\ell(r)$, where $V_\ell(r)$
is the effective potential (\ref{e:ges:V_eff_timelike}). Note however that
when $a\neq 0$, $\mathcal{V}(r)$ cannot be considered as an effective
potential for the radial motion, because it depends on $\veps$, in addition
to $\ell$, even if we substract from it the constant term $1 - \veps^2$.
This is why we did not bother to add a $1/2$ factor in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:timel_drdtau}),
as we did for Eq.~(\ref{e:ges:1d_motion_timelike}) to make it match
the first integral of a 1-dimensional motion in a potential well.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Existence of circular timelike orbits}

The simplest equatorial geodesics are of course the circular ones:
a \defin{circular orbit in the equatorial plane}\index{circular!orbit}\index{orbit!circular --}
is a geodesic that obeys
\be
    \forall\tau\in\mathbb{R},\quad \theta(\tau) = \pi/2 \qand r(\tau) = r_0 = \mathrm{const} .
\ee
The constant $r_0$ is called the \defin{radius}\index{radius!of circular orbit} of the circular
orbit.
One has then $\D r/\D\tau = 0$, so that Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:timel_drdtau}) implies
\be \label{e:gek:circ_V_zero}
    \encadre{ \mathcal{V}(r_0) = 0 }.
\ee
The above condition is not sufficient to single out a geodesic worldline:
there exist worldlines with constant $r=r_0$ that obey the whole system
(\ref{e:gek:equat_time_system}) (which includes (\ref{e:gek:circ_V_zero}))
but that are not solution of the
geodesic equation (\ref{e:gek:eq_geod})
(see Ref.~\cite{Vanae20} for concrete examples). One must add a second condition, which
is obtained as follows. For any timelike equatorial geodesic (not necessarily
circular), the following relation must hold:
\[
    \derd{r}{\tau} \left[ 2 \dderd{r}{\tau} + \mathcal{V}'(r) \right] = 0 .
\]
It is obtained by differentiating Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:timel_drdtau}) with respect
to $\tau$. If the geodesic is not circular, at any point where $r$ is not
stationary (i.e. excluding $r$-turning points), we have $\D r/\D\tau \neq 0$
and the above relation implies
\[
    \mathcal{V}'(r) = - 2 \dderd{r}{\tau} .
\]
Since in the vicinity of any circular geodesic there exist non-circular ones
(those with small eccentricity $e$, as defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:p_e_ra_rp})), by continuity, we shall ask that this relation
holds for circular geodesics as well. For the latter ones, $r=r_0$ and
$\D^2 r/\D\tau^2 = 0$, so that it simplifies to
\be \label{e:gek:circ_derV_zero}
    \encadre{\mathcal{V}'(r_0) = 0 }.
\ee
One can verify\footnote{See Ref.~\cite{Vanae20} for details.} that this
relation, in conjunction with Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:circ_V_zero}), is sufficient
to eliminate the non-geodesic circular worldlines.

To summarize, circular timelike geodesics in the equatorial plane are
obtained by solving the system (\ref{e:gek:circ_V_zero})-(\ref{e:gek:circ_derV_zero}).
Given expression (\ref{e:gek:def_V_time_equat}) for $\mathcal{V}$, this
system takes the form
\begin{subnumcases}{\label{e:gek:syst_r0_eps_ell}}
(1 - \veps^2) r_0^3  - 2 m r_0^2 + \left[ \ell^2 + a^2 (1-\veps^2) \right] r_0
    - 2m (\ell - a\veps)^2 = 0  \\
2 m r_0^2 - 2 \left[ \ell^2 + a^2 (1-\veps^2) \right] r_0 + 6 m (\ell - a\veps)^2 = 0 .
\end{subnumcases}
This is a system of 2 nonlinear equations for 3 unknowns: $r_0$, $\veps$ and $\ell$.
We thus expect a 1-parameter family of solutions. It is convenient to choose
$r_0$ as the parameter. We have thus to solve (\ref{e:gek:syst_r0_eps_ell})
for $(\veps,\ell)$. The change of variable
\be \label{e:gek:def_tilde_l}
    \tilde{\ell} := \ell - a \veps
\ee
turns (\ref{e:gek:syst_r0_eps_ell}) into the system
\begin{subnumcases}{}
r_0^3 \veps^2 =  m \tilde{\ell}^2 + r_0^2 (r_0 - m) \label{e:gek:r03_eps2} \\
2 a r_0 \, \veps\tilde{\ell} = (3m - r_0) \tilde{\ell}^2 + r_0 ( m r_0 - a^2) . \label{e:gek:ar0_eps_ell}
\end{subnumcases}
Let us consider the square of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:ar0_eps_ell}):
\be \label{e:gek:ar0_eps_ell_square}
    4 a^2 r_0^2\,  \veps^2 \tilde{\ell}^2 = \left[ (3m - r_0) \tilde{\ell}^2 + r_0 ( m r_0 - a^2) \right] ^2 ,
\ee
and substitute (\ref{e:gek:r03_eps2}) for $\veps^2$ in it; we get
\[
    \left[ r_0 (r_0 - 3m)^2  - 4 a^2 m \right] \tilde{\ell}^4
    + 2 r_0^2 \left[ (3 m^2 - a^2) r_0 - m (r_0^2 + a^2)\right] \tilde{\ell}^2
        + r_0^3 (m r_0 - a^2)^2 = 0 .
\]
This is a quadratic equation for $X:=\tilde{\ell}^2$. Its discrimant turns out to
have a simple form:
\[
 \mathit{\Delta} = 16 a^2 m r_0^3 (r_0^2 - 2m r_0 + a^2)^2 .
\]
It follows immediately that $\mathit{\Delta} \geq 0 \iff r_0 \geq 0$. Hence, there is
no solution for $r_0 < 0$:
\begin{greybox}
There does not exist any equatorial circular timelike orbit in the region $r<0$ of
Kerr spacetime.
\end{greybox}
\begin{remark}
For $r_0 < 0$ with $|r_0|\gg m$, the above result is not surprising since we
have seen in Sec.~\ref{s:ker:basic_prop} that under these conditions,
the Kerr metric appears as a Schwarzschild metric with a negative mass. The
asymptotic gravitational field is then repulsive and certainly does not admit
any circular orbit. In the region $r < 0$ and $|r|$ small, the above argument does not apply.
However, the results obtained in Sec.~\ref{s:gek:r-motion}
show that if a circular orbit would exist there, it would necessarily
have $|E| > \mu$ [cf. Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:neg_r_large_E})], i.e. would be unbound.
\end{remark}
The case $r_0=0$ is excluded as well, since in the equatorial plane, it would
correspond to the curvature singularity. In what follows, we therefore assume
\be \label{e:gek:circ_r0_positive}
    r_0 > 0 .
\ee
We have then $\sqrt{\mathit{\Delta}} = 4 a r_0 \sqrt{m r_0} |r_0^2 - 2m r_0 + a^2|$
and the solutions of the quadratic equation are\footnote{For future convenience, we have
chosen the sign $\mp$ in the numerator to be the opposite of the label $\pm$
in $\tilde{\ell}^2_{\pm}$.}
\be \label{e:gek:sol_tell2}
    \tilde{\ell}^2_{\pm} = r_0 \frac{ (a^2 - 3m^2) r_0^2 + m r_0 (r_0^2 + a^2)
    \mp 2 a \sqrt{m r_0} (r_0^2 - 2m r_0 + a^2)}{r_0 (r_0 - 3m)^2  - 4 a^2 m} .
\ee
The denominator of the right-hand side can be written as
\[
    r_0 (r_0 - 3m)^2  - 4 a^2 m = \frac{1}{r_0} \left[
        \left( r_0 (r_0 - 3m) \right) ^2 - \left( 2 a \sqrt{m r_0} \right) ^2 \right]
        = \frac{1}{r_0} A_+ A_- ,
\]
with
\[
    A_\pm := r_0 (r_0 - 3m) \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0} .
\]
In the numerator of (\ref{e:gek:sol_tell2}), we may use the identity
$\mp 2 a \sqrt{m r_0} = A_\mp - r_0 (r_0 - 3m)$ and get, after
simplification,
\[
    \tilde{\ell}^2_{\pm} = \frac{r_0^2}{A_+ A_-} \left[ A_\mp (r_0^2 - 2m r_0 + a^2)
     - A_+ A_- \right] = \frac{r_0^2}{A_\pm} \left(
        r_0^2 - 2m r_0 + a^2 - A_\pm \right) .
\]
Using $r_0^2 - 2m r_0 + a^2 - A_\pm  =  a^2 \mp 2a \sqrt{m r_0} + m r_0 =
(a \mp \sqrt{m r_0})^2$, we obtain
\be \label{e:gek:tell2_circ}
    \tilde{\ell}^2_{\pm} = \frac{r_0^2 (a \mp \sqrt{m r_0})^2}{r_0^2 - 3m r_0 \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0}} .
\ee
Since obviously $\tilde{\ell}^2_{\pm} \geq 0$, this expression gives birth to
the constraint $r_0^2 - 3m r_0 \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0} > 0$,
which is equivalent to
\be \label{e:gek:cubic_sqrt_r0}
    r_0^{3/2} - 3 m r_0^{1/2}  \pm 2 a \sqrt{m} > 0 .
\ee
The left hand-side of this inequality is a cubic polynomial in $x:=r_0^{1/2}$
and determining its sign amounts to compute its roots. Fortunately, this
corresponds to
a depressed cubic equation $x^3 + px + q = 0$, with $p:= -3m$ and $q:=\pm 2 a \sqrt{m}$,
the discrimant of which is $-(4 p^3 + 27 q^2) = 108 m (m^2 - a^2) \geq 0$. The roots
$(x_k)_{k\in\{0,1,2\}}$ are then all real and are given by Viète's formula (\ref{e:gis:Viete}).
They obey $x_0 + x_1 + x_2 = 0$ and $x_0 x_1 x_2 = -q = \mp 2 a \sqrt{m}$,
from which we deduce that for $\pm = +$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:cubic_sqrt_r0}), i.e. for
$\tilde{\ell}^2_+$, there are two positive roots, which are $x_0$ and $x_2$
as given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Viete}), while for $\pm = -$, i.e. for
$\tilde{\ell}^2_-$, there is a single positive root, which is $x_0$ as
given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gis:Viete}).
Going back to $r_0 = x^2$, with the roots $x_0$ and $x_2$ given by
Viète's formula (\ref{e:gis:Viete}), we get the following constraints
for circular orbits in the equatorial plane:
\begin{subequations}
\label{e:gek:range_circ}
\begin{align}
    & \mbox{for}\ \tilde{\ell}^2_+:\qquad
    0 < r_0 < r_* \qquad\mbox{or}\qquad r_0 > r_{\rm min}^+ \label{e:gek:range_circ_plus} \\
    & \mbox{for}\ \tilde{\ell}^2_-:\qquad r_0 > r_{\rm min}^- , \label{e:gek:range_circ_minus}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with
\be \label{e:gek:def_r_min_pm}
   \encadre{ r_{\rm min}^\pm := 4m\cos^2 \left[ \frac{1}{3} \arccos\left( \mp \frac{a}{m} \right) \right] }
\ee
and
\be \label{e:gek:def_r_star}
   \encadre{ r_* := 4m\cos^2 \left[ \frac{1}{3} \arccos\left(-\frac{a}{m} \right)  + \frac{4\pi}{3} \right] } .
\ee

$r_{\rm min}^\pm$ and $r_*$ are plotted as functions of $a$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:circ_orb_lim}
(green curves).
Note that $m\leq r_{\rm min}^+ \leq 3 m$ and $3m \leq r_{\rm min}^- \leq 4m$,
with
\be
    \lim_{a\to 0} r_{\rm min}^\pm = 3m, \quad
    \lim_{a\to m} r_{\rm min}^+ = m, \quad
    \lim_{a\to m} r_{\rm min}^- = 4 m .
\ee
Besides, $0 \leq r_* \leq m$, with
\be
    \lim_{a\to 0} r_* = 0, \quad
    \lim_{a\to m} r_* = m .
\ee
Furthermore, one can check that
\be
    r_{\rm min}^\pm \geq r_+
\ee
and
\be \label{e:gek:rs_range}
    0 \leq r_* \leq r_- ,
\ee
where $r_+ := m^2 - \sqrt{m^2 - a^2}$ and $r_- := m^2 - \sqrt{m^2 - a^2}$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:ker:def_r_pm})]
are the radii of respectively the event horizon $\Hor$ and the inner horizon $\Hor_{\rm in}$.
Regarding the upper bound in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:rs_range}), one can see from Fig.~\ref{f:gek:circ_orb_lim} that $r_*$ is always very close to $r_-$. The maximum discrepancy is
$r_- - r_* \simeq  0.032 \, m$ (achieved for $a\simeq 0.9 \, m$).
We conclude that the first permitted range for circular orbits in (\ref{e:gek:range_circ_plus}) lies
entirely in the region $\M_{\rm III}$ of Kerr spacetime, while the second range
in (\ref{e:gek:range_circ_plus}) lies in entirely in $\M_{\rm I}$. Regarding
the orbits for $\tilde{\ell}^2_-$, the range (\ref{e:gek:range_circ_minus}) lies in $\M_{\rm I}$
as well.

Substituting expression (\ref{e:gek:tell2_circ})
for $\tilde{\ell}^2$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:r03_eps2}), we get,
after simplification,
\be \label{e:gek:eps2_circ}
    \veps^2_{\pm} = \frac{\left( r_0^2 -2m r_0 \pm a \sqrt{mr_0} \right) ^2}{r_0^2\left(r_0^2 - 3m r_0 \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0}\right)} .
\ee
The $\pm$'s in Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:tell2_circ}) and (\ref{e:gek:eps2_circ}) have
to be consistent. In other words, we have two pairs of solutions for
$(\veps^2, \tilde{\ell}^2)$, namely $(\veps_+^2, \tilde{\ell}_+^2)$
and $(\veps_-^2, \tilde{\ell}_-^2)$.
A priori, $\veps_+^2$ leads to two values for $\veps$, namely $\pm\sqrt{\veps_+^2}$,
and $\tilde{\ell}_+^2$ leads to two values for $\tilde{\ell}$, namely $\pm\sqrt{\tilde{\ell}_+^2}$,
so that the pair $(\veps_+^2, \tilde{\ell}_+^2)$ would generate four solutions
for $(\veps, \tilde{\ell})$, and similarly the pair $(\veps_-^2, \tilde{\ell}_-^2)$ would generate four extra solutions for $(\veps, \tilde{\ell})$, leading to a total of eight solutions.
However, by construction these solutions satisfy the ``squared'' equation (\ref{e:gek:ar0_eps_ell_square})
but not all of them satisfy the original equation (\ref{e:gek:ar0_eps_ell}).
To see this, let us consider the following square roots of Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:eps2_circ})
and (\ref{e:gek:tell2_circ}):
\be \label{e:gek:veps_circ}
    \encadre{ \veps_{\pm} = \frac{r_0^2 -2m r_0 \pm a \sqrt{mr_0}}{r_0\sqrt{r_0^2 - 3m r_0 \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0}}} },
\ee
\be \label{e:gek:tell_circ}
    \tilde{\ell}_{\pm} = - \frac{r_0 (a \mp \sqrt{m r_0})}{\sqrt{r_0^2 - 3m r_0 \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0}}} = \frac{r_0 (\pm \sqrt{m r_0} - a)}{\sqrt{r_0^2 - 3m r_0 \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0}}}
\ee
and write the eight solutions of (\ref{e:gek:ar0_eps_ell_square}) as
\[
    (\veps, \tilde{\ell}) = \left( \epsilon_1 \veps_\pm, \epsilon_2 \tilde{\ell}_\pm \right) ,
    \qquad\mbox{with}\quad \epsilon_1 = \pm 1\qand \epsilon_2 = \pm 1.
\]
By a direct calculation, we get
\[
    2 a r_0 \, \veps\tilde{\ell} - (3m - r_0) \tilde{\ell}^2 - r_0 ( m r_0 - a^2)
    =  \frac{2(1 - \epsilon_1 \epsilon_2) a r_0 (a \mp \sqrt{m r_0}) (r_0^2 - 2m r_0 \pm a\sqrt{m r_0})}{r_0^2 - 3m r_0 \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0}} .
\]
Hence Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:ar0_eps_ell}) is fulfilled iff $ 1 - \epsilon_1 \epsilon_2 = 0$, i.e.
iff $\epsilon_1 \epsilon_2 = 1$.
This reduces the number of possible solutions from eight to four:
\be \label{e:gek:circ_four_sol}
    (\veps, \tilde{\ell}) = (\veps_+, \tilde{\ell}_+)\quad\mbox{or}\quad
        (-\veps_+, -\tilde{\ell}_+)\quad\mbox{or}\quad
        (\veps_-, \tilde{\ell}_-)\quad\mbox{or}\quad  (-\veps_-, -\tilde{\ell}_-) .
\ee
A further reduction of the number of solutions is provided by the future-directed condition (\ref{e:gek:future_directed}).
Since $R(r_0) = -\mu^2 r_0^4 \mathcal{V}(r_0) = 0$ by virtue of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:circ_V_zero}),
for circular equatorial orbits, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:future_directed}) reduces to
\[
\frac{1}{\Delta_0} \left( \veps - \frac{a}{r_0^2 + a^2} \ell \right) > 0 ,
\]
where $\Delta_0 := r_0^2 - 2 m r_0 + a^2 = (r_0 - r_+)(r_0 - r_-)$. Now, we have
observed above that circular orbits lie either in $\M_{\rm I}$ or $\M_{\rm III}$,
where $\Delta_0 > 0$. Therefore, we can further simplify the future-directed condition to
\[
   \veps - \frac{a}{r_0^2 + a^2} \ell > 0 .
\]
Once reexpressed in terms of $\tilde{\ell} = \ell - a \veps$, it is equivalent to
\be
    r_0^2 \veps - a \tilde{\ell}  >  0 .
\ee
Let us check each of the four solutions (\ref{e:gek:circ_four_sol}):
\begin{align}
  & r_0^2 \veps_+ - a \tilde{\ell}_+ = \frac{r_0 \Delta_0}{\sqrt{r_0^2 - 3m r_0 + 2 a \sqrt{m r_0}}} > 0 \nonumber \\
  & r_0^2 (-\veps_+) - a (-\tilde{\ell}_+) = - (r_0^2 \veps_+ - a \tilde{\ell}_+) < 0 \nonumber \\
  & r_0^2 \veps_- - a \tilde{\ell}_- = \frac{r_0 \Delta_0}{\sqrt{r_0^2 - 3m r_0 - 2 a \sqrt{m r_0}}} > 0 \nonumber \\
  & r_0^2 (-\veps_-) - a (-\tilde{\ell}_-) = - ( r_0^2 \veps_- - a \tilde{\ell}_- ) < 0 . \nonumber
\end{align}
We conclude that only two solutions remain:
\be
    (\veps, \tilde{\ell}) = (\veps_+, \tilde{\ell}_+)\quad\mbox{or}\quad
        (\veps_-, \tilde{\ell}_-) .
\ee

\subsection{Stability of circular timelike orbits}

A circular orbit at $r=r_0$ obeys both $\mathcal{V}(r_0) = 0$ and $\mathcal{V}'(r_0) = 0$
[Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:circ_V_zero}) and (\ref{e:gek:circ_derV_zero})]. The latter property means that
it corresponds to a local extremum of the function $\mathcal{V}$. This extremum can be either
a local maximum (red curve in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:V_stability}) or a local minimum
(blue curve in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:V_stability}).
Now, in view of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:timel_drdtau}) rewritten as $\mathcal{V}(r) = - (\D r/ \D\tau)^2$, any motion in the equatorial plane must obey $\mathcal{V}(r) \leq 0$. If the circular orbit
corresponds to a local minimun, then for $r$ close to $r_0$, but distinct from it,
$\mathcal{V}(r) > 0$, since $\mathcal{V}(r_0) = 0$ (cf. the blue curve in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:V_stability}). This means that no geodesic motion with the same values of the
conserved quantities $\veps$ and $\ell$
is possible in the vicinity of $r_0$ except for precisely $r=r_0$. We conclude that the circular orbit at $r_0$ is stable in that case.
On the contrary, when $r_0$ is a local maximum of $\mathcal{V}$, one has
$\mathcal{V}(r) < 0$
for $r$ close to $r_0$, but distinct from it (cf. the red curve in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:V_stability}).
Motion away from $r_0$ is then possible for the same values of $\veps$ and $\ell$; we conclude that the circular orbit is unstable in that
case. Assuming that $\mathcal{V}''(r_0)\neq 0$, a local minimum (resp. maximum) is equivalent to
$\mathcal{V}''(r_0) > 0$ (resp. $\mathcal{V}''(r_0) < 0$). We have then
\be \label{e:gek:stability_circ_V}
    \mbox{The circular orbit of radius $r_0$ is stable} \iff
    \mathcal{V}''(r_0) > 0 .
\ee

From the definition (\ref{e:gek:def_V_time_equat}) of $\mathcal{V}(r)$ and the
relation $\ell = \tilde{\ell} + a\veps$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_tilde_l})], we get
\[
    \mathcal{V}''(r_0) = - \frac{4 m}{r_0^3}
    + \frac{6(\tilde{\ell}^2 + 2a\veps\tilde{\ell} + a^2)}{r_0^4}
    - \frac{24m\tilde{\ell}^2}{r_0^5} .
\]
Substituting Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:ar0_eps_ell}) for $2a\veps\tilde{\ell}$, we get
a simple expression, involving only $\tilde{\ell}$:
\[
    \mathcal{V}''(r_0) = \frac{2m}{r_0^3} \left( 1 - 3 \frac{\tilde{\ell}^2}{r_0^2} \right) .
\]
For a circular orbit, $\tilde{\ell}$ is the function (\ref{e:gek:tell_circ}) of $r_0$.
Using it, we get
\[
    \mathcal{V}''(r_0) = \frac{2m(r_0^2 - 6 m r_0 \pm 8 a \sqrt{m r_0} - 3 a^2)}{r_0^3(r_0^2 - 3m r_0 \pm 2 a \sqrt{m r_0})} .
\]
Since the denominator of the right-hand-side expression is always positive, by virtue of Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:circ_r0_positive}) and (\ref{e:gek:cubic_sqrt_r0}), the sign of $\mathcal{V}''(r_0)$ is entirely determined by
the numerator, so that we may rewrite (\ref{e:gek:stability_circ_V}) as
\bea
    \mbox{The circular orbit of radius $r_0$ is stable} & \iff &
     r_0^2 - 6 m r_0 \pm 8 a \sqrt{m r_0} - 3 a^2 > 0  \nonumber \\
     & \iff & x^4 - 6 x^2 \pm 8 \bar{a} x - 3 \bar{a}^2 > 0 ,  \label{e:gek:circ_stability_crit}
\eea
where we have introduced the dimensionless variables
\be
    x := \sqrt{\frac{r_0}{m}} \qand \bar{a} := \frac{a}{m} .
\ee
The problem amounts to finding the range of $x$ where the quartic polynomial
$P(x) := x^4 - 6 x^2 \pm 8 \bar{a} x - 3 \bar{a}^2$ is positive. This requires
computing the roots of $P$. We shall do it via Ferrari's
method\index{Ferrari's method}. The first step is to introduce
a parameter $Z_1$ and rewrite $P(x)$ as
\be \label{e:gek:def_P_T}
    P(x) = (x^2 - Z_1)^2 - T(x),\quad\mbox{with}\quad
    T(x) := 2(3 - Z_1) x^2 \mp 8 \bar{a} x + Z_1^2 + 3 \bar{a}^2 .
\ee
The above expression is an identity, which holds for any value of $Z_1$;
the core of Ferrari's method it to find $Z_1$ so that the quadratic polynomial
$T(x)$ has a double root, $x_0$ say. We will have then $T(x) = S(x)^2$, with
$S(x):=\sqrt{2(3 -  Z_1)}(x - x_0)$, and $P(x) = (x^2 - Z_1)^2 - S(x)^2 = (x^2 - Z_1 - S(x))(x^2 - Z_1  + S(x))$,
so that
\be \label{e:gek:P_zero_S}
    P(x) = 0 \quad\iff\quad x^2 - Z_1 - S(x) = 0 \quad \mbox{or} \quad x^2 - Z_1 + S(x) = 0 .
\ee
In other words, the four (possibly complex) solutions of the quartic equation $P(x)=0$
are the two solutions of the quadratic equation $x^2 - Z_1  - S(x) = 0$ plus the
two solutions of $x^2 - Z_1 + S(x) = 0$. A necessary and sufficient condition
for $T(x)$ to have a double root is that its discriminant vanishes, which is
equivalent to
\be \label{e:gek:cubic_Z1}
  Z_1^3 - 3 Z_1^2 + 3 \bar{a}^2 Z_1 - \bar{a}^2 = 0 .
\ee
We have thus to solve a cubic equation in $Z_1$. Let us reduce it to a depressed
cubic equation (i.e. an equation free of any square term) via the change
of variable $Z_1 =: Z + 1$:
\[
    Z^3 + 3 (\bar{a}^2 - 1) Z + 2 (\bar{a}^2 - 1) = 0 .
\]
The discrimant of this cubic equation is
$\Delta = - (4 p^3 + 27 q^2)$, where $p:= 3 (\bar{a}^2 - 1)$
and $q:=2 (\bar{a}^2 - 1)$. We get $\Delta = - 108 \bar{a}^2 (1 - \bar{a}^2)^2$.
Hence $\Delta < 0$: there exist only one real solution. It is given by
Cardano's formula:
\[
    Z = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{1}{2} \left(-q + \sqrt{\frac{-\Delta}{27}} \right) }
        + \sqrt[3]{ \frac{1}{2} \left(-q - \sqrt{\frac{-\Delta}{27}} \right) }
    = \sqrt[3]{1 - \bar{a}^2} \left( \sqrt[3]{1 + \bar{a}} + \sqrt[3]{1 - \bar{a}} \right) .
\]
Hence
\be \label{e:gek:Z1}
    Z_1 = 1 + \sqrt[3]{1 - \bar{a}^2} \left( \sqrt[3]{1 + \bar{a}} + \sqrt[3]{1 - \bar{a}} \right) .
\ee
$Z_1$ is plotted in terms of $\bar{a} = a/m$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:Z1}.
In particular, we notice that $1 \leq Z_1 \leq 3$.
\begin{figure}

Function $Z_1$, as defined by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:Z1}).
\textsl{[Figure generated by the notebook \ref{s:sam:Kerr_circular_orbits}]}
}
\end{figure}
When $Z_1$ takes the value (\ref{e:gek:Z1}), the double root of $T(x)$ is
$x_0 = \pm {2a}/(3-Z_1)$, where the $\pm$ is the opposite of the $\mp$
in the definition (\ref{e:gek:def_P_T}) of $T(x)$, and therefore indicates
which family of  circular orbits, among $(\veps_+,\ell_+)$ or $(\veps_-,\ell_-)$,
is considered. We have then
\[
    S(x) = \sqrt{2(3-Z_1)} \, x \mp \frac{2\sqrt{2} \bar{a}}{\sqrt{3 - Z_1}} .
\]
When $\bar{a}\to 0$, the ratio $\bar{a}/\sqrt{3 - Z_1}$ is of the undetermined
type ``$0/0$''. We can rearrange it by noticing the identity
${8 \bar{a}^2}/(3 - Z_1) = Z_1^2 + 3 \bar{a}^2$, which is a direct consequence of
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:cubic_Z1}). We then write
\[
     S(x) = \sqrt{2(3-Z_1)} \, x \mp Z_2,\quad\mbox{with}\quad
    Z_2 := \sqrt{Z_1^2  + 3 \bar{a}^2} .
\]
The solutions of $P(x)=0$ are obtained by solving the two quadratic equations
[cf. Eq.~ (\ref{e:gek:P_zero_S})]
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
& x^2 - \sqrt{2(3-Z_1)}\, x - Z_1 \pm Z_2 = 0 \label{e:gek:eq_x_Z1Z2_1} \\
& x^2 + \sqrt{2(3-Z_1)}\, x - Z_1 \mp Z_2 = 0 .  \label{e:gek:eq_x_Z1Z2_2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Moreoever, physically acceptable solutions must obey $x>0$ (recall that
$x := \sqrt{r_0/m}$). The discrimant of (\ref{e:gek:eq_x_Z1Z2_1}) is
$\Delta = 2(3+Z_1\mp Z_2)$. It is non-negative only when $\mp = +$, i.e.
for orbits in the $(\eps_-,\ell_-)$ family. The positive solution of (\ref{e:gek:eq_x_Z1Z2_1})
is then
\[
    x_- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \sqrt{3 + Z_1 + 2 Z_2} + \sqrt{3- Z_1} \right) .
\]
On the other side, the discriminant of (\ref{e:gek:eq_x_Z1Z2_2})
is $\Delta = 2(3+Z_1 \pm 2 Z_2)$. It is non-negative only when $\pm = +$, i.e.
for orbits in the $(\eps_+,\ell_+)$ family. The positive solution of (\ref{e:gek:eq_x_Z1Z2_2})
is then
\[
    x_+ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \sqrt{3 + Z_1 + 2 Z_2} - \sqrt{3- Z_1} \right) .
\]
We conclude that the quartic polynomial $P(x)$ has a single positive root, which
is
\[
    x_\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \sqrt{3 + Z_1 + 2 Z_2} \mp \sqrt{3- Z_1} \right) .
\]
Going back to $r_0 = m x^2$, we get the single solution of $\mathcal{V}''(r_0) = 0$
on $(0, +\infty)$:
\begin{align}
 & \encadre{r_{\rm ISCO}^\pm = m \left[ 3 + Z_2 \mp \sqrt{(3 - Z_1)(3 + Z_1 + 2 Z_2)} \right] } ,
    \label{e:gek:r_ISCO} \\
&  Z_1 := 1 + \sqrt[3]{1 - \bar{a}^2} \left( \sqrt[3]{1 + \bar{a}} + \sqrt[3]{1 - \bar{a}} \right) ; \qquad
  Z_2 := \sqrt{Z_1^2  + 3 \bar{a}^2} ; \qquad \bar{a} := a/m .\nonumber
\end{align}
where $\pm$ indicates which family among $(\veps_+,\ell_+)$ and $(\veps_-,\ell_-)$ is
considered and \emph{ISCO} stands for \defin{innermost stable circular orbit}\index{stable!circular orbit}\index{innermost!stable circular orbit}\index{circular!orbit!innermost stable --}.
Indeed, $r_{\rm ISCO}^\pm $ being the unique zero of $r_0^2 - 6 m r_0 \pm 8 a \sqrt{m r_0} - 3 a^2$,
(\ref{e:gek:circ_stability_crit}) is equivalent to
\be
\mbox{The circular orbit of radius $r_0$ is stable} \quad \iff \quad r_0 > r_{\rm ISCO}^\pm .
\ee
Note that $r_{\rm ISCO}^\pm  / m$ is a function of $\bar{a} := a/m$ only; this
function is depicted in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:circ_orb_isco}. We notice immediately
from it that
\be
    r_* < r_{\rm ISCO}^+
\ee
and conclude that all the inner cicular orbits are unstable.
We also see on Fig.~\ref{f:gek:circ_orb_isco} that in the limit $a=0$,
$r_{\rm ISCO}^+ = r_{\rm ISCO}^- = 6 m$, i.e. we recover the Schwarzschild ISCO
discussed in Sec.~\ref{s:ges:circular_orbits}.

\begin{remark}
The ISCO is also called \defin{marginally stable circular orbit}\index{marginally!stable circular orbit} by some authors (e.g. \cite{BardePT72}), $r_{\rm ISCO}$ is then denoted by $r_{\rm ms}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
For $a = 0.9\, m$, Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:r_ISCO}) yields $r_{\rm ISCO}^+ = 2.32088\, m$. Accordingly,
the prograde circular orbit at $r_0 = 3\, m$ is stable, while that at $r_0 = 2 m$ is unstable,
in agreement with the plot of $\mathcal{V}(r)$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:V_stability}.
\end{example}

An interesting property of the ISCO is that it corresponds to extrema of
$\veps_\pm(r_0)$ and $\ell_\pm(r_0)$:
\begin{greybox}
Among all prograde outer circular orbits, the ISCO is that for which
the functions $\veps_+(r_0)$ and $\ell_+(r_0)$ are minimal.
Similarly, among all retrograde outer circular orbits, the ISCO is that for
which the function $\veps_-(r_0)$ is minimal and the function $\ell_-(r_0)$
is maximal.
\end{greybox}
\begin{proof}
In what precedes, we have considered $\mathcal{V}$, defined by
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_V_time_equat}), as a function of $r$ only. Let us consider
it instead as a function of $(r, \veps, \ell)$: $\mathcal{V} = \mathcal{V}(r, \veps, \ell)$.
What we have denoted by
$\mathcal{V}'(r)$ is then $\dert{\mathcal{V}}{r}$ and
Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:circ_V_zero}) and (\ref{e:gek:circ_derV_zero}) can be rewritten
as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
& \mathcal{V}\left(r_0,\; \veps_\pm(r_0),\; \ell_\pm(r_0)\right) = 0 \label{e:gek:circ_V_zero_r0} \\
& \der{\mathcal{V}}{r} \left(r_0,\; \veps_\pm(r_0),\; \ell_\pm(r_0)\right) = 0 .
    \label{e:gek:circ_derV_zero_r0}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
These equations are valid for any circular orbit, i.e. any value of $r_0$.
Let us take the derivative of Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:circ_V_zero_r0}) with respect to $r_0$.
Using the chain rule, we get
\[
    \underbrace{\left. \der{\mathcal{V}}{r} \right| _0}_{=0}
    + \left. \der{\mathcal{V}}{\eps} \right| _0  \veps_\pm'(r_0)
    + \left. \der{\mathcal{V}}{\ell} \right| _0  \ell_\pm'(r_0) = 0 ,
\]
where $| _0$ means that the quantity is evaluated at $(r,\veps,\ell)=\left(r_0,\; \veps_\pm(r_0),\; \ell_\pm(r_0)\right)$ and the vanishing of the first term results from Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:circ_derV_zero_r0}).
Similarly, deriving Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:circ_derV_zero_r0}) with respect to $r_0$ yields
\[
    \left. \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{V}}{\partial r^2} \right| _0
    + \left. \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{V}}{\partial\eps\partial r} \right| _0  \veps_\pm'(r_0)
    + \left. \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{V}}{\partial\ell\partial r} \right| _0  \ell_\pm'(r_0)
    = 0 .
\]
Now, at the ISCO, one has precisely ${\partial^2\mathcal{V}}/{\partial r^2} |_0 = 0$
($\mathcal{V}''(r_0) = 0$ in the preceding notations). Hence, at the ISCO, the following
two equations must hold:
\[
    \left\{\begin{array}{l}
       \left. \der{\mathcal{V}}{\eps} \right| _0 \;  \veps_\pm'(r_0)
    + \left. \der{\mathcal{V}}{\ell} \right| _0 \;  \ell_\pm'(r_0) = 0 \\
    \left. \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{V}}{\partial\eps\partial r} \right| _0 \;  \veps_\pm'(r_0)
    + \left. \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{V}}{\partial\ell\partial r} \right| _0 \;  \ell_\pm'(r_0) = 0
    \end{array} \right.
\]
This constitutes a linear homogeneous system for the two
unknowns $\left(\veps_\pm'(r_0),\; \ell_\pm'(r_0)\right)$.
Since there are no obvious reason for its determinant to vanish, we deduce that
the only solution is $\left(\veps_\pm'(r_0),\; \ell_\pm'(r_0)\right) = (0, 0)$.
Hence the ISCO realizes an extremum of both $\veps_\pm(r_0)$ and $\ell_\pm(r_0)$.
A quick look at Figs.~\ref{f:gek:eps_circ_orb} and \ref{f:gek:ell_circ_orb},
especially their bottom panels, enables us to conclude that the extremum is
a minimum for $\veps_\pm(r_0)$ and $\ell_+(r_0)$ and a maximum for $\ell_-(r_0)$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Summary}

\begin{greybox}
Equatorial circular timelike orbits exist only in the region $r>0$ of Kerr spacetime.
They are of three kinds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{prograde outer circular orbits}: they are located outside
the black hole event horizon (i.e. in region $\M_{\rm I}$), having a Boyer-Lindquist radius $r_0$ ranging
from  $r_{\rm min}^+ = 4 m \cos^2[\arccos(-a/m)/3]$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_r_min_pm})] to $+\infty$;
the minimal radius
$r_{\rm min}^+$ decreases monotically from $3m$ ($a=0$) to $m$ ($a=m$).
These orbits are unstable for
$r_{\rm min}^+ < r_0 \leq r_{\rm ISCO}^+$ and stable for $r_0 > r_{\rm ISCO}^+$,
where $r_{\rm ISCO}^+$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:r_ISCO}),
decreasing monotically from $6m$ ($a=0$) to $m$ ($a=m$).
Their specific conserved energy and angular momentum
are $\veps = \veps_+(r_0) >  0$ and $\ell = \ell_+(r_0) > 0$, with
$\veps_+(r_0)$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:veps_circ}) and $\ell_+(r_0)$ by
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:ell_circ}), both being plotted as the solid
curves in the region $r_0 \geq m$ of Figs.~\ref{f:gek:eps_circ_orb} and \ref{f:gek:ell_circ_orb}.
The functions $\veps_+(r_0)$ and $\ell_+(r_0)$ are minimal at the ISCO.
\item The \emph{retrograde outer circular orbits}: they are located outside
the black hole event horizon (i.e. in region $\M_{\rm I}$), having a Boyer-Lindquist radius $r_0$ ranging
from $r_{\rm min}^- = 4 m \cos^2[\arccos(a/m)/3]$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_r_min_pm})] to $+\infty$; the minimal radius
$r_{\rm min}^-$ increases monotically from $3m$ ($a=0$) to $4m$ ($a=m$).
These orbits are unstable for
$r_{\rm min}^- < r_0 \leq r_{\rm ISCO}^-$ and stable for $r_0 > r_{\rm ISCO}^-$,
where $r_{\rm ISCO}^-$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:r_ISCO}),
increasing monotically from $6m$ ($a=0$) to $9m$ ($a=m$).
Their specific conserved energy and angular momentum
are $\veps = \veps_-(r_0) > 0$ and $\ell = \ell_-(r_0) < 0$, with
$\veps_-(r_0)$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:veps_circ}) and $\ell_-(r_0)$ by
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:ell_circ}), both being plotted as the dashed
curves in Figs.~\ref{f:gek:eps_circ_orb} and \ref{f:gek:ell_circ_orb}.
The functions $\veps_-(r_0)$ and $|\ell_-(r_0)|$ are minimal at the ISCO.
\item The \emph{inner circular orbits}: they are located inside the inner horizon
(in the part $r>0$ of region $\M_{\rm III}$),
having a Boyer-Lindquist radius $r_0$ ranging
from $0$ (the ring singularity) to
$r_* = 4 m \cos^2[\arccos(-a/m)/3 + 4\pi/3]$
[Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_r_star})];
the maximal radius $r_*$ increases monotically from $0$ ($a=0$) to $m$ ($a=m$).
These orbits are all unstable. Their specific conserved energy and angular momentum
are $\veps = \veps_+(r_0)$ and $\ell = \ell_+(r_0)$, with
$\veps_+(r_0)$ given by Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:veps_circ}) and $\ell_+(r_0)$ by
Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:ell_circ}), both being plotted as the solid
curves in the region $r_0 \leq m$ of Figs.~\ref{f:gek:eps_circ_orb} and \ref{f:gek:ell_circ_orb}.
\end{enumerate}
In particular, there are no equatorial circular orbits in region $\M_{\rm II}$ of Kerr spacetime.

\subsection{Angular velocity of circular timelike orbits}

The coordinate angular velocity $\Omega := \D\ph/\D t$ along a timelike circular orbit is
obtained by combining Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:timel_dtdtau}) and (\ref{e:gek:timel_dphdtau}):
\[
    \Omega = \frac{\D\ph}{\D\tau} \times \frac{\D\tau}{\D t}
        = \frac{ \left( 1 - \frac{2m}{r_0} \right) \ell
    + \frac{2 am \veps}{r_0} }{(r_0^2 + a^2) \veps + \frac{2 a m}{r_0} (a\veps - \ell)} .
\]
Using $\tilde{\ell} = \ell - a\veps$ [Eq.~(\ref{e:gek:def_tilde_l})] instead of $\ell$, we
get
\[
    \Omega = \frac{(r_0 - 2m) \tilde{\ell} + a r_0 \veps}{r_0(r_0^2 + a^2) \veps
    - 2 a m \tilde{\ell}} .
\]
Substituting $\veps$ and $\tilde{\ell}$ by the actual values $\veps_\pm$
and $\tilde{\ell}_\pm$ taken on a circular orbit [Eqs.~(\ref{e:gek:veps_circ})
and (\ref{e:gek:tell_circ})], we obtain, after simplification,
\be \label{e:gek:Omega_circ}
    \encadre{\Omega_\pm = \pm \frac{\sqrt{m}}{r_0^{3/2} \pm a \sqrt{m}} } ,
\ee
where $\Omega_+$ is the value of $\Omega$ for prograde outer circular orbits
and inner circular orbits and $\Omega_-$ is the value for retrograde
outer circular orbits. $\Omega_+$ and $\Omega_-$ are drawn in term of $r_0$
in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:omega_circ_orb}. Note that for $r_0 \gtrsim 7\, m$,
the effect of spin parameter $a$ on $\Omega_\pm$ is hardly perceptible.

\subsection{Marginally bound circular orbit}

We see on Fig.~\ref{f:gek:eps_circ_orb} that for $a \neq m$ and $r_0$ lower than a critical
value, $r_{\rm mb}^+$ say, the prograde outer circular orbits have $\veps > 1$
(cf. the grey horizontal line in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:eps_circ_orb}), which is equivalent to
$E>\mu$; they are thus unbound (cf. Sec.~\ref{s:gek:bound_geod}). Conversely, all
orbits with $r_0 > r_{\rm mb}^+$ are bound.
Similarly, but this time of all values of $a\leq m$,
the retrograde outer circular orbits are bound iff $r_0$ is larger than
a critical value, $r_{\rm mb}^-$ say. The orbit at $r_0 = r_{\rm mb}^\pm$ is
called the \defin{marginally bound circular orbit}\index{marginally!bound!circular orbit}\index{circular!orbit!marginally bound --}.

We note from Fig.~\ref{f:gek:eps_circ_orb} that
\be
    r_{\rm min}^\pm < r_{\rm mb}^\pm < r_{\rm ISCO}^\pm .
\ee
Accordingly, all unbound orbits are unstable.

To evaluate $r_{\rm mb}^\pm$, let us solve the equation $\veps_\pm(r_0) = 1$ for $r_0$.
Using expression (\ref{e:gek:veps_circ}) for $\veps_\pm(r_0)$, taking the square
and simplifying, we get
\[
    r_0^2 - 4 m r_0 \pm 4 a \sqrt{m r_0} - a^2 = 0 ,
\]
which we can write
\[
    r_0^2 = (2\sqrt{mr_0} \mp a)^2  .
\]
Since we are looking for solutions $r_0 \geq r_+ = m + \sqrt{m^2 - a^2}$, we have
$2\sqrt{m r_0} \mp a > 0$, so that we can reduce the above equation to
$r_0 = 2\sqrt{m r_0} \mp a$. Introducing $x := \sqrt{r_0/m}$, we end up solving
the quadratic equation $x^2 - 2 x \pm a/m = 0$.
The only solution $x \geq 1$, which is implied by $r_0 \geq r_+$, is
$x = 1 + \sqrt{1 \mp a/m}$. This yields
\be \label{e:gek:r_mb_circ}
    \encadre{ r_{\rm mb}^\pm = 2 m \mp a + 2 \sqrt{m(m\mp a)} } .
\ee
$r_{\rm mb}^\pm$ is plotted as a function of $a$ in Fig.~\ref{f:gek:circ_orb_isco}.

\begin{hist}
The solutions for the circular geodesic motion in the equatorial plane
for outer prograde and outer retrograde orbits have been published for the first
time by James M. Bardeen\index{Bardeen, J.M.}, William H. Press\index{Press, W.H.} and Saul A. Teukolsky\index{Teukolsky, S.A.} in 1972 \cite{BardePT72}. In his lecture notes at the famous
1972 Les Houches School \cite{Barde73}, Bardeen says that they have been derived by Teukolsky.
In the article \cite{BardePT72}, it is mentioned that they have been derived by means of
computer algebra techniques.
